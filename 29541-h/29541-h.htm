v</span>NOTE.</h2>
<p>A series of papers which originally appeared in
&lsquo;Fraser&rsquo; are now, for the first time, published in a
collected form with the consent of the proprietors of that
Magazine.&nbsp; It should, however, be stated, that this is not a
mere reprint, but that other matter has been inserted, and
several illustrations, which did not appear originally, are now
added, by which the work is very materially increased: the whole
having undergone a necessary revision.</p>
<p>Since the late Mr. Crofton Croker contributed to
&lsquo;Fraser&rsquo; the &lsquo;Walk from London to
Fulham,&rsquo; there have been many important changes on the
road: time has continued to efface interesting associations; more
old houses have been pulled down, new ones built up, and great
alterations and improvements have taken place not contemplated a
few years ago.&nbsp; It would be impossible, for example, that
any one who has not visited the locality during the last few
years could recognize the narrow lanes <!-- page vi--><a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>of yesterday
in the fine roads now diverging beyond the South Kensington
Museum, which building has so recently been erected at the
commencement of Old Brompton; but modern improvements are
seemingly endless, and have of late become frequent.&nbsp; It is
in the belief that the following pages will be an interesting and
acceptable record of many places no longer in existence, that
they are submitted to the public in their present shape by</p>

<span class="smcap">of the late</span><br />
THOMAS CROFTON CROKER, F.S.A., M.R.I.A., <span
class="smcap">etc.</span></h2>
<p>The late eminent genealogist, Sir W. Betham of Dublin, Ulster
King-at-Arms, well known as the author of numerous works on the
Antiquities of Ireland, and Mr. Richard Sainthill, an equally
zealous antiquary still living in Cork, were two of the most
intimate friends and correspondents of the late Mr. Crofton
Croker.</p>
<p>The first-named gentleman drew up an elaborate table tracing
the Croker pedigree as far back as the battle of Agincourt.&nbsp;
The Croker crest&mdash;&ldquo;Deus alit eos&rdquo;&mdash;was
granted to Sir John Croker, who accompanied Edward IV. on his
expedition to France in 1475, as cup and standard-bearer; but
without going back to the original generation, or tracing the
Limerick or any other branch of the family, it will be sufficient
to say here that the Crokers, if they did not &ldquo;come over
with William the Conqueror&rdquo; came originally from
Devonshire, and settled in Ireland in the reign of
Elizabeth.&nbsp; Thomas Crofton Croker was the only son of Thomas
Croker, who, after twenty-five years of arduous and <!-- page
x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>faithful
military service in North America, Holland, and Ireland, and
after having purchased every step in the army, was gazetted
brevet-major on the 11th May, 1802, in the same regiment which he
had at first joined (the 38th, or 1st Staffordshire Foot), and in
which he had uninterruptedly served.&nbsp; Indeed, he was so much
attached to his regiment, that, in his case at least, the
Staffordshire knot became perfectly symbolic.&nbsp; The closer
the knot was drawn the firmer the tie became.&nbsp; He commenced,
continued, and ended an honourable life of activity in the
service of his country from mere boyhood, until ill-health and a
broken constitution forced him to sell his commission.&nbsp;
Thomas Croker was the eldest son of Richard Croker, of Mount Long
in the county of Tipperary, who died on the 1st January, 1771;
and his mother was Anne, the daughter of James Long of Dublin, by
the Honourable Mary Butler, daughter of Theobald the seventh Earl
of Cahir.&nbsp; Thomas Croker was born on the 29th March,
1761.&nbsp; In 1796 he married Maria, eldest daughter and co-heir
of Croker Dillon of Baltidaniel in the county of Cork, and on the
15th January, 1798, Thomas Crofton Croker was born at the house
of his maternal grandmother in Buckingham Square, Cork, receiving
his first Christian name after his father, and his second after
his godfather, the Honourable Sir E. Crofton, Bart.</p>
<p>While very young, during the years 1812 and 1815, Crofton
Croker made several excursions in the south of Ireland, studying
the character and traditions of the country, on which occasions
he was frequently accompanied by Mr. Joseph Humphreys, a Quaker,
afterwards master of the <!-- page xi--><a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>Deaf and Dumb
Institution at Claremont near Dublin.&nbsp; In 1813 he was placed
with the mercantile firm of Messrs. Lecky and Mark, and in 1817
he appeared as an exhibitor in the second exhibition of the Cork
Society, for he had already displayed considerable talent as an
artist.&nbsp; In 1818 he contributed to an ephemeral production
called &lsquo;The Literary and Political Examiner:&rsquo; on the
22nd March of that year his father died, and he left Ireland, not
to revisit it until he made a short excursion there in 1821 with
Alfred Nicholson and Miss Nicholson (who afterwards became Mrs.
Croker), children of the late Mr. Francis Nicholson, one of the
founders of the English water-colour school, and who died in 1844
at the patriarchal age of ninety-one years.</p>
<p>Crofton Croker&rsquo;s first visit to England was paid to
Thomas Moore in Wiltshire; and soon after his establishing in
London he received from the late Right Hon. John Wilson Croker an
appointment at the Admiralty, of which office his namesake (but
no relation) was secretary, and from which he (Crofton) retired
in 1850 as senior clerk of the first class, having served upwards
of thirty years, thirteen of which were passed in the highest
class.&nbsp; This retirement, although he stood first for
promotion to the office of chief clerk, was compulsory upon a
reduction of office, and was not a matter of private
convenience.&nbsp; In 1830 Crofton Croker married Miss Marianne
Nicholson, and the result of their union was an only child,
Thomas Francis Dillon Croker, born 26th August, 1831, the writer
of the present memoir.</p>
<p>The literary labours of Crofton Croker were attended <!-- page
xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>with more gratifying results than his long and
unwearied official services.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Researches in the
South of Ireland&rsquo; (1824), an arrangement of notes made
during several excursions between the years 1812 and 1822, was
his first important work.&nbsp; It was published by John Murray,
the father of the present publisher of the &lsquo;Quarterly
Review,&rsquo; and contained illustrations by Mr. Alfred and Miss
Nicholson: with the &lsquo;Fairy Legends,&rsquo; however, the
name of Crofton Croker became more especially associated, the
first edition of which appeared anonymously in 1825, and produced
a complimentary letter from Sir Walter Scott, which has been
published in all subsequent editions.&nbsp; The success of the
first edition of the legends was such as immediately to justify a
second, which appeared the next year, illustrated with etchings
after sketches by Maclise, and which was followed by a second
series (Parts 2 and 3) in 1827.&nbsp; The third part, although it
appeared under the same title, namely &lsquo;Fairy Legends and
Traditions of the South of Ireland,&rsquo; may be considered as
forming almost a separate work, inasmuch as it comprised the
fairy superstitions of Wales and other countries, in addition to
those current in Ireland.&nbsp; A translation of the legends by
the Brothers Grimm appeared in Germany in 1825, and another in
Paris in 1828 (&lsquo;Les Contes Irlandais,
pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute;s d&rsquo;une introduction par M. P.
A. Dufau&rsquo;), but it was not until 1834 that Murray published
them in a condensed form in his &lsquo;Family Library,&rsquo; the
copyright of which edition, as revised by the author, was
purchased of Murray by the late Mr. Tegg, and is now published by
his son.&nbsp; In October, 1826, Croker was introduced to Sir
<!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>Walter Scott at Lockhart&rsquo;s in Pall Mall.&nbsp;
Sir Walter recorded the interview thus:&mdash;&ldquo;At breakfast
Crofton Croker, author of the Irish fairy tales&mdash;little as a
dwarf, keen-eyed as a hawk, and of easy, prepossessing manners,
something like Tom Moore.&nbsp; Here were also Terry, Allan
Cunningham, Newton, and others.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this meeting, Sir
Walter Scott suggested the adventures of Daniel O&rsquo;Rourke as
the subject for the Adelphi pantomime, and, at the request of
Messrs. Terry and Yates, Croker wrote a pantomime founded upon
the legend, which was produced at the Adelphi the same
year.&nbsp; It succeeded, and underwent two editions: the second
was published in 1828, uniform with the legends, and entitled
&lsquo;Daniel O&rsquo;Rourke; or, Rhymes of a Pantomime, founded
on that Story.&rsquo;&nbsp; Croker wrote to his sister (Mrs. Eyre
Coote, alive at the present time) the following account of the
breakfast party at Lockhart&rsquo;s, which, though already
published in &lsquo;The Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine&rsquo;
(November, 1854), is sufficiently interesting to be
repeated.&nbsp; He first mentions &ldquo;the writing and
preparing for the Adelphi Theatre a Christmas pantomime from the
renowned adventures of Daniel O&rsquo;Rourke, two or three
meetings with Sir Walter Scott, some anxious experiments in
lithography under the directions of Mr. Coindet, one of the
partners of Englemann&rsquo;s house of Paris, who has lately
opened an establishment here, which will be of the utmost
importance to the advancement of the art in this country, and of
which I hope soon to send you specimens.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he
adds: &ldquo;To tell half the kindness and attention which I
received from Sir Walter Scott would be impossible.&nbsp; The
breakfast party at Lockhart&rsquo;s consisted of <!-- page
xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>Allan Cunningham, Terry (the actor), Newton (the
artist), a Dr. Yates of Brighton, Captain, Mr., and Mrs.
Lockhart, Miss Scott, Mr. Hogg, and your humble servant.&nbsp; We
had all assembled when Sir Walter entered the room.&nbsp;
Maclise&rsquo;s sketch does not give his expression, although
there is certainly a strong likeness&mdash;a likeness in it which
cannot be mistaken; but I have a very rough profile sketch in pen
and ink by Newton, which is admirable, and which some time or
other I will copy and send you.&nbsp; When I was introduced to
the &lsquo;Great Unknown&rsquo; I really had not the power of
speaking; it was a strange feeling of embarrassment, which I do
not remember having felt before in so strong a manner; and of
course to his &lsquo;I am glad to see you, Mr. Croker, you and I
are not unknown to each other,&rsquo; I could say nothing.&nbsp;
He contrived to say something neat to every one in the kindest
manner&mdash;a well-turned compliment, without, however, the
slightest appearance of flattery&mdash;something at which every
one felt gratified.&nbsp; After speaking for a few moments to Mr.
Terry and Allan Cunningham, he returned to where I stood fixed
and &lsquo;mute as the monument on Fish Street Hill;&rsquo; but I
soon recovered the use of my tongue from the easy manner in which
he addressed me, and no longer seemed to feel myself in the
presence of some mighty and mysterious personage.&nbsp; He spoke
slowly, with a Scotch accent, and in rather a low tone of voice,
so much so, indeed, that I found it difficult to catch every
word.&nbsp; He mentioned my &lsquo;Fairy Legends,&rsquo; and
hoped he should soon have the very great enjoyment of reading the
second volume.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are our&mdash;I speak of the
Celtic nations&rsquo; (said Sir Walter)&mdash;&lsquo;great
authority now on fairy <!-- page xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>superstition, and have made Fairy
Land your kingdom; most sincerely do I hope it may prove a golden
inheritance to you.&nbsp; To me,&rsquo; (continued Sir Walter)
&lsquo;it is the land of promise of much future
entertainment.&nbsp; I have been reading the German translation
of your tales and the Grimms&rsquo; very elaborate
introduction.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Terry mentioned having received
from me Daniel O&rsquo;Rourke in the shape of a Christmas
pantomime.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is an admirable subject,&rsquo; said
Sir Walter, &lsquo;and if Mr. Croker has only dramatized it with
half the skill of tricking up old wives&rsquo; tales which he has
shown himself to possess, it must be, and I prophesy, although I
have not seen it, it will be as great a golden egg in your nest,
Terry, as Mother Goose was to one of the greater theatres some
years ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then repeated by heart part of the
conversation between Dan and the Eagle, with great zest.&nbsp; I
must confess it was most sweet from such a man.&nbsp; But really
I blush, or ought to blush, at writing all this
flattery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the origin of Maclise&rsquo;s
illustrations to the legends is thus given by the editor of the
&lsquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine.&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
artist, who had not then quitted his native city of Cork, was a
frequent visitor to Mr. Sainthill (the author of &lsquo;Olla
Podrida&rsquo;), at the time that the first edition of the work
appeared.&nbsp; Mr. Sainthill read the tales aloud from time to
time in the evening, and Maclise would frequently, on the next
morning, produce a drawing of what he had heard.&nbsp; These were
not seen by Mr. Croker until his next visit to Cork: but when he
did see them he was so much pleased with them that he prevailed
upon Mr. Sainthill to allow them to be copied for his forthcoming
edition: and this was done by Maclise, and <!-- page xvi--><a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>the
drawings were engraved by W. H. Brooke, and Maclise&rsquo;s name
was not attached to them, but merely mentioned by Mr. Croker in
his preface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott made favourable mention of the &lsquo;Fairy
Legends&rsquo; in the collected edition of the &lsquo;Waverley
Novels&rsquo; published in 1830.&nbsp; In a note on Fairy
Superstitions to Chapter XI. of &lsquo;Rob Roy,&rsquo; speaking
of the elfin traditions peculiar to the wild scenery where Avon
Dhu or the River Forth has its birth, he observes: &ldquo;The
opinions entertained about these beings are much the same with
those of the Irish, so exquisitely well narrated by Mr. Crofton
Croker.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, in his &lsquo;Letters on Demonology
and Witchcraft,&rsquo; Scott says: &ldquo;We know from the lively
and entertaining legends published by Mr. Crofton Croker, which,
though in most cases, told with the wit of the editor and the
humour of his country, contain points of curious antiquarian
information&rdquo; as to what the opinions of the Irish
are.&nbsp; And again, speaking of the Banshee: &ldquo;The subject
has been so lately and beautifully investigated and illustrated
by Mr. Crofton Croker and others, that I may dispense with being
very particular regarding it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was indeed
gratifying from such an authority.&nbsp; The late Thomas Haynes
Bayley dedicated to Crofton Croker a volume entitled &lsquo;Songs
from Fairy Land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having dwelt at considerable length upon the legends, the
required limits of this notice will not permit more than a
reference to the literary works of Mr. Croker which succeeded
them; and as there is but occasion for their enumeration, they
shall be here given in the order of their appearance, merely
premising that the tales of <!-- page xvii--><a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>&lsquo;Barney Mahoney&rsquo; and &lsquo;My Village
<i>versus</i> Our Village,&rsquo; were not by Mr. Croker,
although they bore his name: they were, in reality, written by
Mrs. Croker.&nbsp; The list stands thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>1828&ndash;9.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Christmas-Box, an Annual
Present for Children, a collection of Tales edited by Mr. Croker,
and published by Harrison Ainsworth&rsquo; (Sir Walter Scott,
Lockhart, Ainsworth, Maria Edgeworth, and Miss Mitford were among
the contributors).</p>
<p>1829.&nbsp; &lsquo;Legends of the Lakes; or, Sayings and
Doings at Killarney, collected chiefly from the Manuscripts of R.
Adolphus Lynch, Esq., H. P. King&rsquo;s German Legion, with
illustrations by Maclise (Ebers).&rsquo;&nbsp; A second edition,
compressed into one volume as a guide to the Lakes, appeared in
1831.&nbsp; (Fisher.)</p>
<p>From this time Croker became contributor to the
&lsquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;Fraser&rsquo;s&rsquo;
Magazines.&nbsp; In 1832 he was a steward at the famous literary
dinner given to Hogg the Ettrick Shepherd.</p>
<p>1835.&nbsp; &lsquo;Landscape Illustrations to Moore&rsquo;s
Irish Melodies, with Comments for the Curious.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Only
one number appeared.)&nbsp; (Power.)</p>
<p>1837.&nbsp; &lsquo;A Memoir of Joseph Holt, General of the
Irish Rebels in 1798.&nbsp; From Holt&rsquo;s Autobiographical
MS. in the possession of Sir W. Betham.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(Colburn.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Journal of a Tour through Ireland in 1644,
translated from the French of M. de la Boullaye le Gouz, assisted
by J. Roche, Father Prout, and Thomas Wright.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(Boone.)&nbsp; Dedicated to the elder Disraeli, &ldquo;in
remembrance of much attention and kindness received from him <!--
page xviii--><a name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xviii</span>many years ago;&rdquo; which dedication was cordially
responded to by that author.</p>
<p>1839.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Popular Songs of Ireland.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(Colburn.)</p>
<p>1843.&nbsp; A Description of Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower, Fulham <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a> (the residence of Mr. Croker for eight
years), with an inventory of the pictures, furniture,
curiosities, etc., etc.&nbsp; (Privately printed.)</p>
<p>It was here that Moore, Rogers, Maria Edgeworth, Lucy Aikin,
&ldquo;Father Prout&rdquo; (Mahony), Barham (Ingoldsby), Sydney
Smith, Jerdan, Theodore Hook, Lover, Planch&eacute;, Lords
Braybrooke, Strangford, and Northampton, Sir G. Back, John
Barrow, Sir Emerson Tennent, Wyon, Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall, T.
Wright, and many others were the guests of Mr. Croker.&nbsp; One
room in the house was fitted up as a Museum, where such visitors
delighted to assemble.</p>
<p>During subsequent years Mr. Croker produced several minor
works on antiquarian and popular subjects, some of them printed
for private circulation among his friends, and others as
contributions to the different societies of which he was a
member.&nbsp; He died at his residence, 3, Gloucester Road, Old
Brompton, on the 8th of August, 1854, aged 57, and was buried in
the private grave of his father-in-law, Mr. Francis Nicholson, in
the Brompton Cemetery, a sketch of which, by Mr. Fairholt,
appears in these pages.&nbsp; It should not be forgotten that Mr.
Crofton Croker was a contributor to the &lsquo;Amulet,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Literary Souvenir,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Friendship&rsquo;s
Offering,&rsquo; as well as (more extensively) to <!-- page
xix--><a name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xix</span>the &lsquo;Literary Gazette,&rsquo; when that journal
possessed considerable influence under the editorship of W.
Jerdan.&nbsp; Mr. Croker also edited for the Camden and Percy
Societies (in the formation of which he took an active part) many
works of antiquarian interest.&nbsp; He was connected, also, with
the British Arch&aelig;ological Association as one of the
secretaries (1844&ndash;9) under the presidency of Lord Albert
Conyngham (the late Lord Londesborough).&nbsp; That
recently-deceased nobleman was one of Mr. Croker&rsquo;s most
attached friends, and opposite his Lordship&rsquo;s pew in
Grimston church, Yorkshire, a neat marble tablet was erected
bearing the following inscription: &ldquo;In memory of Thomas
Crofton Croker, Esq., the amiable and accomplished author of the
&lsquo;Fairy Legends of Ireland,&rsquo; and other works, Literary
and Antiquarian.&nbsp; This tablet is erected by his friend Lord
Londesborough, 1855.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To enumerate all the societies and institutions of which
Crofton Croker was a member, honorary or otherwise, would in
these pages be superfluous; but one society shall be here
especially mentioned as originating with Mr. Croker and a few
members of the Society of Antiquaries.&nbsp; In 1828 a club was
established, composed of a select few F.S.A.&rsquo;s, in
consequence of an excursion during the summer to the site, which,
in the time of the Romans, had been occupied by the city of
Noviomagus.&nbsp; In a field at Keston, near Bromley Common in
Kent, Mr. Croker had learned that the remains of a Roman building
were apparent above the grass, and it was to ascertain this fact
that the excursion was undertaken.&nbsp; An excavation was made,
and a few fragments of Roman pottery and a stone coffin were
discovered.&nbsp; From <!-- page xx--><a name="pagexx"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xx</span>this circumstance the club was called
the Noviomagian Society.&nbsp; Mr. Croker was elected its
president, and although most of the original members had died
off, he continued in that office until within a very few months
of his death.&nbsp; There are amongst them at the present time
many highly-valued friends of their late president, who succeed
in keeping up their meetings in the true Noviomagian
spirit.&nbsp; Long may they be spared to assemble together,
occasionally introducing fresh life to the little society, that
its pleasant gatherings may not be allowed to die out!&nbsp; A
portrait of Mr. Croker was painted a few years before his death
by Mr. Stephen Pearce (the artist of the &lsquo;Arctic
Council&rsquo;).&nbsp; It is a characteristic and an admirable
likeness.&nbsp; The next best is that in Maclise&rsquo;s
well-known picture of &lsquo;All Hallow Eve&rsquo; (exhibited in
the Royal Academy in 1833), on which Lover, in describing the
engraving, has remarked: &ldquo;And who is that standing behind
them?&mdash;he seems &lsquo;far more genteel&rsquo; than the rest
of the company.&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;tis Crofton Croker, or, as he
is familiarly called amongst his friends, &lsquo;The honourable
member for fairy-land.&rsquo;&nbsp; There you are, Crofty, my
boy! with your note-book in your hand; and maybe you won&rsquo;t
pick up a trifle in such good company.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be
added, that Mr. Croker was for many years one of the registrars
of the Royal Literary Fund.&nbsp; And now, in drawing this slight
sketch of Mr. Croker&rsquo;s life to a close, the writer hopes
that it may not be an uninteresting addition to the present
volume.</p>

</a>Obliged by circumstances to lead the life of a pendulum,
vibrating between a certain spot distant four miles from London,
and a certain spot just out of the smoke of the
metropolis,&mdash;going into town daily in the morning and
returning in the evening,&mdash;may be supposed, after the
novelty has worn off, from the different ways by which he can
shape his course, to find little interest in his monotonous
movement.&nbsp; Indeed, I have heard many who live a short
distance from town complain of this swinging backwards and
forwards, or, rather, going forwards and backwards over the same
ground every day, as dull and wearisome; but I cannot sympathise
with them.&nbsp; On the contrary, I find that the <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>more
constantly any particular line of road is adhered to, the more
intimate an acquaintance with it is formed, and the more
interesting it becomes.</p>
<p>In some measure, this may be accounted for by studious habits;
a tolerable memory, apt to indulge in recollections of the past,
and to cherish rather than despise, when not impertinent, local
gossip, which re-peoples the district with its former
inhabitants,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Sweet Memory! wafted by thy gentle
gale<br />
Oft up the tide of time I turn my sail,<br />
To view the fairy haunts of long-lost hours<br />
Blest with far greener shades&mdash;far fresher
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have all by heart,&rdquo; observes the author of the
<i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, &ldquo;the true and delightful
reflection of Johnson on local associations, where the scene we
tread suggests to us the men or the deeds which have left their
celebrity to the spot.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are in the presence of
their fame, and feel its influence.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; How often
have I fancied, if the walls by which thousands now daily pass
without a glance of recognition or regard, if those walls could
speak, and name some of their former inmates, how great would be
the regret of many at having overlooked houses which they would
perhaps have made a pilgrimage of miles to behold, as associated
with the memory of persons whose names history, literature, or
art has embalmed for posterity, or as the scene of circumstances
treasured up in recollection!</p>
<p>If the feelings could be recalled, and faithfully recorded,
which the dull brick walls that I cannot help regarding with
interest must have witnessed, what a romantic chapter <!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>in
the history of the human mind would be preserved for study and
reflection!&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Ay, beautiful the dreaming brought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By valleys and green fields;<br />
But deeper feeling, higher thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is what the City yields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The difficulty, however, is incredible of procuring accurate
information as to any thing which has not been chronicled at the
moment.&nbsp; None but those who have had occasion to search
after a date, or examine into a particular fact, can properly
estimate their value, or the many inquiries that have to be made
to ascertain what at first view would appear to be without
embarrassment,&mdash;so deceptive is the memory, and so easy a
thing is it to forget, especially numbers and localities, the
aspect and even names of which change with a wonderful degree of
rapidity in the progress of London out of town.&nbsp; Thus many
places become daily more and more confused, and at last
completely lose their identity, to the regret of the
contemplative mind, which loves to associate objects with the
recollection of those who &ldquo;have left their celebrity to the
spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These considerations have induced the writer to arrange his
notes, and illustrate them by such sketches as will aid the
recognition of the points mentioned, the appearance of which must
be familiar to all who have journeyed between London and
Fulham,&mdash;a district containing, beside the ancient village
of that name, and remarkable as adjacent to the country seat of
the Bishop of London, two smaller villages, called Walham Green
and Parson&rsquo;s Green.&nbsp; The <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>former of
which stands on the main London road, the latter on the
King&rsquo;s Road,&mdash;which roads form nearly parallel lines
between Fulham and the metropolis.&nbsp; For all information
respecting the neighbourhood of Knightsbridge the reader may be
referred to a recently published work &ldquo;The Memorials of the
Hamlet of Knightsbridge, with notices of its immediate
neighbourhood,&rdquo; by the late Henry George Davis, edited by
Charles Davis (Russell Smith).</p>
<p>From Knightsbridge, formerly a suburb, and now part of London,
the main roads to Fulham and Hammersmith branch off at the north
end of Sloane Street (about a quarter of a mile west of Hyde Park
Corner), thus:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p24.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>And at the south termination of Sloane Street, which is 3,299
feet in length, the King&rsquo;s Road commences from Sloane
Square.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Main Fulham Road</span> passes for
about a mile through a district called by the general name of
Brompton, which <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>is a hamlet in the parish of
Kensington.&nbsp; The house, No. 14 Queen&rsquo;s Buildings,
Knightsbridge, on the left-hand or south side of the road, 
<a href="images/p25.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=
"Hooper&rsquo;s Court"
title=
"Hooper&rsquo;s Court"
src="images/p25.jpg" />
</a>at the corner of Hooper&rsquo;s Court, occupied, when
sketched in 1844, as two shops, by John Hutchins, dyer, and Moses
Bayliss, tailor, and now (1860) by Hutchins alone, was, from 1792
to 1797 inclusive, the residence of Mr. J. C. Nattes, an artist,
who deserves notice as one of the sixteen by whose association,
in 1805, the first exhibition of water-colour paintings was
formed.</p>
<p>From 1792 to 1797 this house was described as No. 14
Queen&rsquo;s Buildings, Knightsbridge; but in the latter year
the address was changed to No. 14 Knightsbridge Green. <a
name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a>&nbsp; In 1800 it was known as No. 14
Knightsbridge, and in 1803 as No. 14 Queen&rsquo;s Row,
Knightsbridge. <a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a>&nbsp; In 1810 as Gloucester Buildings,
Brompton. <a name="citation25c"></a><a href="#footnote25c"
class="citation">[25c]</a>&nbsp; In 1811 as Queen&rsquo;s
Buildings. <a name="citation25d"></a><a href="#footnote25d"
class="citation">[25d]</a>&nbsp; In 1828 as Gloucester Row. <a
name="citation25e"></a><a href="#footnote25e"
class="citation">[25e]</a>&nbsp; In 1831 as Gloucester Buildings;
<a name="citation25f"></a><a href="#footnote25f"
class="citation">[25f]</a> and it has now reverted to its
original name of Queen&rsquo;s Buildings, <i>Knightsbridge</i>,
in opposition to Queen&rsquo;s Buildings, <i>Brompton</i>, the
division being Hooper&rsquo;s Court, if, indeed, the original
name was not <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Queen&rsquo;s <i>Row</i>,
Knightsbridge, as this in 1772 was the address of William Wynne
Ryland (the engraver who was hanged for forgery in 1783).&nbsp;
When houses began to be built on the same side of the way, beyond
Queen&rsquo;s <i>Row</i>, the term &ldquo;<i>Buildings</i>&rdquo;
appears to have been assumed as a distinction from the row west
of Hooper&rsquo;s Court; which row would naturally have been
considered as a continuation, although, in 1786, the Royal
Academy Catalogue records Mr. J. G. Huck, an exhibitor, as
residing at No. 11 Gloster Row, Knightsbridge.</p>
<p>These six alterations of name within half a century, to say
nothing of the previous changes, illustrate the extreme
difficulty which attends precise local identification in London,
and are merely offered at the very starting point as evidence at
least of the desire to be accurate.</p>
<p>About the year 1800, the late residence of Mr. Nattes became
the lodgings of Arthur Murphy, too well known as a literary
character of the last century to require here more than the mere
mention of his name, even to those who are accustomed to
associate every thing with its pecuniary value; as Murphy&rsquo;s
portrait, painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds for Mr. Thrale, sold at
Christie&rsquo;s in the sale of Mr. Watson Taylor&rsquo;s
pictures (June, 1823), for &pound;94 10s.&nbsp; Murphy had
prepared his translation of Tacitus <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a> for the press, at
his house on Hammersmith Terrace (the last at the west end); but
declining health and circumstances induced his removal into
lodgings near London, at &ldquo;14 Knightsbridge.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From these apartments &ldquo;he soon removed to others in
Brompton Row, where he did not <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>remain long,
not liking the mistress of the house, but returned to his former
residence (No. 14), where he resided till the time of his
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1803, the late Lord Sidmouth (then Mr.
Addington), conferred a pension of &pound;200 a-year on Murphy,
&ldquo;to mark the sense&rdquo; his majesty entertained &ldquo;of
literary merit, particularly when accompanied with sound
principles and unquestionable character;&rdquo; which gracious
mark of royal favour Murphy acknowledged on the 2nd of March,
from &ldquo;14 Queen&rsquo;s Row, Knightsbridge.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here he wrote his life of Garrick, <a name="citation27a"></a><a
href="#footnote27a" class="citation">[27a]</a> a work which,
notwithstanding Mr. Foot&rsquo;s ingenious defence of it, shews
that Garrick&rsquo;s life remains to be written, and that
Murphy&rsquo;s intellectual powers were, at the time when he
composed it, in a state of decay.</p>
<p>Murphy, according to his biographer, &ldquo;possessed the
first and second floors of a very pleasant, neat house, where
there was a long gravel walk in the garden; <a
name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a> and though his library had been much
diminished, yet, in the remaining part, he took care to reserve
the Elzevir editions of the classics.&nbsp; Mrs. Mangeon (the
mistress of the house) was a neat and intelligent woman, and Mr.
Murphy secured her friendship by giving her son a presentation to
Christ&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp; Anne Dunn, his own servant-maid,
was an excellent servant, honest, faithful, and attentive; so
that, what with the services he had rendered to the mistress of
the house, and what with the intrinsic fidelity of his female
domestic, he could put the whole family into <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>a state of
requisition, and command an elegant table, as well as ready
attention, upon any particular occasion.&nbsp; Such was the
situation of a man of genius, and an author, in the decline of a
long life, and in a country at the highest pitch of grandeur and
wealth.&nbsp; But it must be remembered, that the comforts he
possessed were not derived from the profits of
literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the last year of Arthur Murphy&rsquo;s life he
possessed a certain income of &pound;500, and added to this was
&pound;150 for the copyright of his Tacitus, which, however, was
less than half the sum he had been frequently offered for
it.&nbsp; The translation of Sallust, which Murphy left
unfinished, was completed by Thomas Moore, and published in
1807.</p>
<p>Murphy appears to have perfectly reconciled his mind to the
stroke of death.&nbsp; He made his will thirteen days previous to
it, and dictated and signed plain and accurate orders respecting
his funeral.&nbsp; He directed his library of books and all his
pictures to be sold by auction, and the money arising therefrom,
together with what money he might have at his bankers or in his
strong box, he bequeathed to his executor, Mr. Jesse Foot, of
Dean Street, Soho.&nbsp; To Mrs. Mangeon (his landlady) he gave
&ldquo;all his prints in the room one pair of stairs and whatever
articles of furniture&rdquo; he had in her house, &ldquo;the
bookcase excepted.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to his servant, Anne Dunn,
&ldquo;twenty guineas, with all his linen and wearing
apparel.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the completion of this will, Murphy
observed, &ldquo;I have been preparing for my journey to another
region, and now do not care how soon I take my
departure.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on the <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>day of his
death (18th June, 1805) he frequently repeated the lines of
Pope:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Taught, half by reason, half by mere
decay,<br />
To welcome death and calmly pass away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that we can further glean respecting the interior of
Murphy&rsquo;s apartment is, that in it &ldquo;there was a
portrait of Dunning (Lord Ashburton), a very striking likeness,
painted in crayons by Ozias Humphrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humphrey, who was portrait-painter in crayons to George III.,
and in 1790 was elected member of the Royal Academy, resided, in
1792 and 1793, at No. 19 Queen&rsquo;s Buildings,
<i>Knightsbridge</i>; but whether this was the fifth house beyond
Nattes&rsquo;, or the No. 19 Queen&rsquo;s Buildings, now called
<i>Brompton Road</i> (Mitchell&rsquo;s, a linen-draper&rsquo;s
shop), I am unable, after many inquiries, to determine.&nbsp; It
will be remembered that Dr. Walcott (Peter Pindar) introduced
Opie to the patronage of Humphrey, and there are many allusions
to &ldquo;honest Ozias,&rdquo; as he was called in the
contemporary literature.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But Humphrey, by whom shall your labours
be told,<br />
How your colours enliven the young and the old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>is the comment of Owen Cambridge; and Hayley says,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Thy graces, Humphrey, and thy colours
clear,<br />
From miniatures&rsquo; small circle disappear;<br />
May their distinguished merit still prevail,<br />
And shine with lustre on the larger scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A portrait of Ozias Humphrey, painted by Romney in 1772, is
preserved at Knowle, a memorial of the visit of those artists to
the Duke of Dorset.&nbsp; It has been twice engraved, and the
private plate from it, executed by <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Caroline
Watson in 1784, is a work of very high merit.&nbsp; In 1799
Humphrey resided at No. 13 High Row, Knightsbridge, nearly
opposite to the house in which Murphy lodged, and there, with the
exception of the last few months, he passed the remainder of his
life.</p>
<p>At No. 21 Queen&rsquo;s Buildings (the second house beyond
that occupied by Ozias Humphrey), Mr. Thomas Trotter, an
ingenious engraver and draughtsman, resided in 1801.&nbsp; He
engraved several portraits, of which the most esteemed are a head
of the Rev. Stephen Whiston and a head of Lord Morpeth.&nbsp;
Nearly the last work of his burin was a portrait of Shakspeare,
patronized by George Steevens.&nbsp; Trotter died on the 14th
February, 1803, having been prevented from following his
profession in consequence of a blow on one of his eyes,
accidentally received by the fall of a flower-pot from a
window.&nbsp; He, however, obtained employment in making drawings
of churches and monuments for the late Sir Richard Hoare, and
other gentlemen interested in topographical illustration.</p>
<p>Queen&rsquo;s Buildings, Brompton, are divided, rather than
terminated, at No. 28 (Green&rsquo;s, an earthenware-shop) by New
Street, leading into Hans Place&mdash;&ldquo;snug Hans
Place,&rdquo; which possesses one house, at least, that all
literary pilgrims would desire to turn out of their direct road
to visit.&nbsp; Miss Landon, alluding to &ldquo;the fascinations
of Hans Place,&rdquo; playfully observes, &ldquo;vivid must be
the imagination that could discover them&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Never hermit in his cell,<br />
Where repose and silence dwell,<br />
Human shape and human word<br />
Never seen and never heard,&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>had a life of duller calm than the indwellers of our
square.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hans Place may also be approached from
Sloane Street, and No. 22 Hans Place, is the south-east
corner.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p31.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=
"No. 22 Hans Place"
title=
"No. 22 Hans Place"
src="images/p31.jpg" />
</a>Among its inmates have been Lady Caroline Lamb, <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> Miss Mitford, Lady Bulwer, Miss Landon,
Mrs. S. C. Hall, and Miss Roberts.&nbsp; How much of the
&ldquo;romance and reality&rdquo; of life is in a moment conjured
up in the mind by the mention of the names here grouped in local
association!</p>
<p>The editor of the memoirs of L. E. L. records two or three
circumstances which give a general interest to Hans Place.&nbsp;
Here it was that Miss Landon was born on the 14th August, 1802,
in the house now No. 25; and &ldquo;it is remarkable that the
greater portion of L. E. L.&rsquo;s existence was passed on the
spot where she was born.&nbsp; From Hans Place and its
neighbourhood she was seldom absent, and then not for any great
length of time; until within a year or two of her death, she had
there found her home, not indeed in the house of her birth, but
close by.&nbsp; Taken occasionally during the earlier years of
childhood into the <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>country, it was to Hans Place she
returned.&nbsp; Here some of her school time was passed.&nbsp;
When her parents removed she yet clung to the old spot, and, as
her own mistress, chose the same scene for her residence.&nbsp;
When one series of inmates quitted it, she still resided there
with their successors, returning continually after every
wandering, &lsquo;like a blackbird to his nest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partiality of Miss Landon for London was
extraordinary.&nbsp; In a letter, written in 1834, and addressed
to a reverend gentleman, she ominously says, &ldquo;When I have
the good luck or ill luck (I rather lean to the latter opinion)
of being married, I shall certainly insist on the wedding
excursion not extending much beyond Hyde Park Corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When in her sixth year (1808), Miss Landon was sent to school
at No. 22 Hans Place.&nbsp; This school was then kept by Miss
Bowden, who in 1801 had published &lsquo;A Poetical Introduction
to the Study of Botany,&rsquo; <a name="citation32a"></a><a
href="#footnote32a" class="citation">[32a]</a> and in 1810 a poem
entitled &lsquo;The Pleasures of Friendship.&rsquo; <a
name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b"
class="citation">[32b]</a>&nbsp; Miss Bowden became the Countess
St. Quentin, and died some years ago in the neighbourhood of
Paris.&nbsp; In this house, where she had been educated, Miss
Landon afterwards resided for many years as a boarder with the
Misses Lance, who conducted a ladies&rsquo; school.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; observes the biographer of L. E. L.,
&ldquo;to have been appropriated to such purposes from the time
it was built, nor was L. E. L. the first who drank at the
&lsquo;well of English&rsquo; within its walls.&nbsp; Miss
Mitford, we believe, was educated there, and Lady Caroline Lamb
was an inmate for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the remark of Miss Landon herself, that &ldquo;a history
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>of the how and where works of imagination have been
produced would often be more extraordinary than the works
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Her own case,&rdquo; observes a
female friend, &ldquo;is, in some degree, an illustration of
perfect independence of mind over all external
circumstances.&nbsp; Perhaps to the L. E. L., of whom so many
nonsensical things have been said, as that she should write with
a crystal pen, dipped in dew, upon silver paper, and use for
pounce the dust of a butterfly&rsquo;s wing, a dilettante of
literature would assign for the scene of her authorship a
fairy-like boudoir, with rose-coloured and silver hangings,
fitted with all the luxuries of a fastidious taste.&nbsp; How did
the reality agree with this fancy sketch?&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p33.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=
"Attic, No. 22 Hans Place"
title=
"Attic, No. 22 Hans Place"
src="images/p33.jpg" />
</a>Miss Landon&rsquo;s drawing-room, <a name="citation33"></a><a
href="#footnote33" class="citation">[33]</a> indeed, was prettily
furnished, but it was her invariable habit to write in her
bed-room.&nbsp; I see it now, that homely-looking, almost
uncomfortable room, fronting the street, and barely furnished
with a simple white bed, at the foot of which was a small, old,
oblong-shaped, sort of dressing-table, quite covered with a
common worn writing-desk, heaped with papers, while some strewed
the ground, the table being too small for aught besides the desk;
a little high-backed cane chair, which gave you any idea rather
than that of comfort.&nbsp; A few books scattered about completed
the author&rsquo;s paraphernalia.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>In this attic did the muse of L. E. L. dream of and
describe music, moonlight, and roses, and &ldquo;apostrophise
loves, memories, hopes, and fears,&rdquo; with how much ultimate
appetite for invention or sympathy may be judged from her
declaration that, &ldquo;there is one conclusion at which I have
arrived, that a horse in a mill has an easier life than an
author.&nbsp; I am fairly fagged out of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Roberts, who had resided in the same house with Miss
Landon, prefixed a brief memoir to a collection of poems by that
lamented lady, which appeared shortly after her death, her own
mournful lines&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;<i>Alas</i>! <i>hope is not
prophecy</i>&mdash;<i>we dream</i>,<br />
<i>But rarely does the glad fulfilment come</i>;<br />
<i>We leave our land</i>, <i>and we return no
more</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And within less than twenty months from the selection of these
lines they became applicable to her who had quoted them.</p>
<p>Emma Roberts accompanied her sister, Mrs. M&rsquo;Naughten, to
India, where she resided for some time.&nbsp; On her
sister&rsquo;s death Miss Roberts returned to England, and
employed her pen assiduously and advantageously in illustrating
the condition of our eastern dominions.&nbsp; She returned to
India, and died at Poonah, on the 17th September, 1840.&nbsp;
Though considerably the elder, she was one of the early friends
of Miss Landon, having for several years previous to her first
visit to India boarded with the Misses Lance in Hans Place.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These were happy days, and little boded the
premature and melancholy fate which awaited them in foreign
climes.&nbsp; We believe,&rdquo; says the editor of the
&lsquo;Literary Gazette,&rsquo; &ldquo;that it was the example of
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>the literary pursuits of Miss Landon which stimulated
Miss Roberts to try her powers as an author, and we remember
having the gratification to assist her in launching her first
essay&mdash;an historical production, <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a> which reflected high
credit on her talents, and at once established her in a fair
position in the ranks of literature.&nbsp; Since then she has
been one of the most prolific of our female writers, and given to
the public a number of works of interest and value.&nbsp; The
expedition to India, on which she unfortunately perished, was
undertaken with comprehensive views towards the further
illustration of the East, and portions of her descriptions have
appeared as she journeyed to her destination in periodicals
devoted to Asiatic pursuits.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The influence of Miss Landon&rsquo;s literary popularity upon
the mind of Miss Roberts very probably caused that lady to desire
similar celebrity.&nbsp; Indeed, so imitative are the impulses of
the human mind, that it may fairly be questioned if Miss Landon
would ever have attuned her lyre had she mot been in the presence
of Miss Mitford&rsquo;s and Miss Rowden&rsquo;s &ldquo;fame, and
felt its influence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Mitford has chronicled so
minutely all the sayings and doings of her school-days in Hans
Place (H. P., as she mysteriously writes it), that she admits us
at once behind the scenes.&nbsp; She describes herself as sent
there (we will not supply the date, but presume it to be
somewhere about 1800) &ldquo;a petted child of ten years old,
born and bred in the country, and as shy as a hare.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The schoolmistress, a Mrs. S---, &ldquo;seldom came near
us.&nbsp; Her post was to sit all day, nicely dressed, in a
nicely-furnished drawing-room, busy with some piece of delicate
needlework, receiving mammas, aunts, and godmammas, answering
questions, and administering as much praise as she
conscientiously could&mdash;<!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>perhaps a
little more.&nbsp; In the school-room she ruled, like other
rulers, by ministers and delegates, of whom the French teacher
was the principal.&rdquo;&nbsp; This French teacher, the daughter
of an <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> of distinction, left, upon the
short peace of Amiens, to join her parents in an attempt to
recover their property, in which they succeeded.&nbsp; Her
successor is admirably sketched by Miss Mitford; and the mutual
antipathy which existed between the French and English teacher,
in whom we at once recognise Miss Rowden:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Never were two better haters.&nbsp; Their
relative situations had probably something to do with it, and yet
it was wonderful that two such excellent persons should so
thoroughly detest each other.&nbsp; Miss R.&rsquo;s aversion was
of the cold, phlegmatic, contemptuous, provoking sort; she kept
aloof, and said nothing.&nbsp; Madame&rsquo;s was acute, fiery,
and loquacious; she not only hated Miss R., but hated for her
sake knowledge, and literature, and wit, and, above all, poetry,
which she denounced as <i>something fatal and contagious</i>,
<i>like the plague</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Mitford&rsquo;s literary and dramatic tastes seem to have
been acquired from Miss Rowden, whom she describes as &ldquo;one
of the most charming women that she had ever
known:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The pretty word <i>graziosa</i>, by which
Napoleon loved to describe Josephine, seemed made for her.&nbsp;
She was full of a delicate grace of mind and person.&nbsp; Her
little elegant figure and her fair mild face, lighted up so
brilliantly by her large hazel eyes, corresponded exactly with
the soft, gentle manners which were so often awakened into a
delightful playfulness, or an enthusiasm more charming still, by
the impulse of her quick and ardent spirit.&nbsp; To be sure she
had a slight touch of distraction about her (distraction French,
not distraction English), an interesting absence of mind.&nbsp;
She united in her own person all the sins of forgetfulness of all
the young ladies; mislaid her handkerchief, her shawl, her
gloves, her work, her music, her <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>drawing, her
scissors, her keys; would ask for a book when she held it in her
hand, and set a whole class hunting for her thimble, whilst the
said thimble was quietly perched upon her finger.&nbsp; Oh! with
what a pitying scorn our exact and recollective Frenchwoman used
to look down on such an incorrigible scatterbrain!&nbsp; But she
was a poetess, as Madame said, and what could you expect
better!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was Miss Landon&rsquo;s schoolmistress; and under this
lady&rsquo;s especial instruction did Miss Mitford pass the years
1802, 3, and 4; together they read &ldquo;chiefly poetry;&rdquo;
and &ldquo;besides the readings,&rdquo; says Miss Mitford,
&ldquo;Miss R. compensated in another way for my unwilling
application.&nbsp; She took me often to the theatre; whether as
an extra branch of education, or because she was herself in the
height of a dramatic fever, it would be invidious to
inquire.&nbsp; The effect may be easily foreseen; my enthusiasm
soon equalled her own; we began to read Shakspeare, and read
nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1810 Miss Mitford first appeared as an authoress, by
publishing a volume of poems, which, in the course of the
following year, passed into a second edition.</p>
<p>At No. 21 Hans Place, the talented artistes, Mr. and Mrs.
Alfred Wigan, resided some time.</p>
<p>Returning from Hans Place to the Fulham Road through <span
class="smcap">New Street</span>, No. 7 may he pointed out as the
house formerly occupied by Chalon, &ldquo;animal painter to the
royal family;&rdquo; and No. 6 as the residence of the Right Hon.
David R. Pigot, the late Solicitor-General for Ireland, while (in
1824&ndash;25) studying in the chambers of the late Lord
Chief-Justice Tindal, for the profession of which his pupil
rapidly became an eminent member.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brompton</span> was formerly an airy
outlet to which the <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>citizen, with his spouse, were wont
to resort for an afternoon of rustic enjoyment.&nbsp; It had also
the reputation of being a locality favourable to intrigue.&nbsp;
Steele, shrewdly writing on the 27th July, 1713, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Wife,&mdash;If you please to call at
Button&rsquo;s, we will go together to Brompton.</p>

<p>Now is Brompton all built or being built over, which makes the
precise locality of crescents and rows puzzling to old
gentlemen.&nbsp; Its heath is gone, and its grove represented by
a few dead trunks and some unhealthy-looking trees which stand by
the road-side, their branches lopped and their growth restrained
by order of the district surveyor; and Brompton National School,
nearly opposite to New Street, a building in the Tudor style,
was, in 1841, wedged in there &ldquo;for the education of 400
children, after the design of Mr. George Godwin, jun.;&rdquo; so
at least the newspapers of the day informed the public.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brompton Row</span> on the north, or

fifty-five respectable-looking houses, uniform, or nearly so, in

</a>He was born at Roncade, near Bassano, in Italy, and died 8th
February, 1839, aged seventy.&nbsp; Vendramini was a pupil of
Bartolozzi, under whom he worked for many years, and of the
effect he produced upon British art much remains to be
said.&nbsp; In 1805 Vendramini visited Russia, and on his return
to England engraved &lsquo;The Vision of St. Catherine,&rsquo;
after Paul Veronese; the &lsquo;St. Sebastian,&rsquo; after
Spagnoletti; &lsquo;Leda,&rsquo; after Leonardo da Vinci; and the
&lsquo;Raising of Lazarus,&rsquo; from the Sebastian del Piombo
in the National Gallery.</p>
<p>No. 14 Brompton Row, in 1842, was the residence of the late
Mr. George Herbert Rodwell, a favourite musical and dramatic
composer, who died January 22nd, 1852.</p>
<p>At No. 23 Brompton Row resided Mr. Walter Hamilton, who, in
1819, published, in two volumes 4to, &lsquo;A Geographical,
Statistical, and Historical Description of Hindostan and the
Adjacent Country;&rsquo; according to Lowndes&rsquo;
&lsquo;Bibliographer&rsquo;s Manual,&rsquo; &ldquo;an inestimable

No. 8 Rawstorne Street, which street divides No. 27 (a
confectioner&rsquo;s shop), and No. 28 (the Crown and Sceptre)
Brompton Row, opposite to the Red Lion (a public-house of which
the peculiar and characteristic style of embellishment could
scarcely have escaped notice at the time when the annexed sketch
was made, 1844, but which decoration was removed in 1849.)&nbsp;
Soon after his return to his house in Brompton Row, Mr. Hamilton
died there in July or August, 1828.</p>
<p>Rawstorne Street leads to Montpellier Square (built about
1837).&nbsp; In this square, No. 11, resides Mr. F. W. Fairholt,
the distinguished artist and antiquary, to whose pencil and for
much valuable information the editor of these pages is greatly
indebted; and No. 38 may be mentioned as the residence of Mr.
Walter Lacy the favourite actor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Liston, the widow of the comedian, resided at No. 35
Brompton Row, and No. 45 was the residence of the ingenious Count
Rumford, the early patron of Sir Humphry Davy.&nbsp; The Count
occupied it between the years 1799 and 1802, when he finally left
England for France, where he married the widow of the famous
chemist, Lavoisier, and died in 1814.&nbsp; Count Rumford&rsquo;s
name was Benjamin Thompson, or Thomson.&nbsp; He was a native of
the small town of Rumford (now Concord, in New England), and
obtained the rank of major in the Local Militia.&nbsp; In the war
with America he rendered important services to <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>the officers
commanding the British army, and coming to England was employed
by Lord George Germaine, and rewarded with the rank of a
provincial lieutenant-colonel, which entitled him to
half-pay.&nbsp;

</a>In 1784 he was knighted, and officiated for a short time as
one of the under-secretaries of state.&nbsp; He afterwards
entered the service of the King of Bavaria, in which he
introduced various useful reforms in the civil and military
departments, and for which he was promoted to the rank of
lieutenant-general, and created a count.&nbsp; At Munich, Count
Rumford began those experiments for the improvements of
fire-places and the plans for the better feeding and regulation
of the poor, which have rendered his name familiar to every
one,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As his own household hearth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. 45 was distinguished some years ago by peculiar projecting
windows, now removed, outside of the ordinary windows&mdash;an
experimental contrivance by Count Rumford, it is said, for
raising the temperature of his rooms.</p>
<p>The same house, in 1810, was inhabited by the Rev. <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>William Beloe, the translator of Herodotus, and the
author of various works between the years 1783 and 1812.&nbsp; In
his last publication, &lsquo;The Anecdotes of Literature,&rsquo;
Mr. Beloe says, &ldquo;He who has written and published not less
than forty volumes, which is my case, may well congratulate
himself, first, that Providence has graciously spared him for so
long a period; secondly, that sufficient health and opportunity
have been afforded; and, lastly, that he has passed through a
career so extended and so perilous without being seriously
implicated in personal or literary hostilities.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is strange that a man who could feel thus should immediately have
entered upon the composition of a work which appeared as a
posthumous publication in 1817, under the title of &lsquo;The
Sexagenarian; or, the Recollections of a Literary Life;&rsquo;
and which contains the following note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dr. Parr branded Beloe as an ingrate and a
slanderer.&nbsp; He says, &lsquo;The worthy and enlightened
Archdeacon Nares disdained to have any concern in this infamous
work.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Rennell, of Kensington, could
know but little of Beloe; but, having read his slanderous book,
Mr. R., who is a sound scholar, an orthodox clergyman, and a most
animated writer, would have done well not to have written a sort
of postscript.&nbsp; From motives of regard and respect for
Beloe&rsquo;s amiable widow, Dr. Parr abstained from refuting
B.&rsquo;s wicked falsehoods; but Dr. Butler, of Shrewsbury,
repelled them very ably in the &lsquo;Monthly
Review.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At No. 46 Brompton Row, Mr. John Reeve, an exceedingly popular
low comedian, died, on the 24th of January, 1838, at the early
age of forty.&nbsp; Social habits led to habits of intemperance,
and poor John was the <i>Bottle Imp</i> of every theatre he ever
played in.&nbsp; &ldquo;The last time I saw him,&rdquo; <!-- page

Mr. Bunn, in his &lsquo;Journal of the Stage,&rsquo; &ldquo;he

<p><span class="smcap">Brompton Grove</span> commences on the
south, or left-hand side of the main Fulham Road, immediately
beyond the Red Lion (before mentioned as opposite to 28 Brompton
Row), and continues to the Bunch of Grapes public-house, which
was pulled down in August, and rebuilt in September, 1844,
opposite to No. 54 Brompton Row, and in the wall of which
public-house was placed a stone, with &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Yeoman&rsquo;s Row</span>, 1767,&rdquo; engraved
upon it&mdash;the name of a street leading to the
&ldquo;Grange,&rdquo; and, in 1794, the address of Michael
Novosielski, the architect of the Italian Opera House.&nbsp; In
that year he exhibited, in the Royal Academy, three architectural
designs, viz:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;558.&nbsp; Elevation of the Opera House, Haymarket;</p>
<p>&ldquo;661.&nbsp; Section of the New Concert Room at the
Haymarket; and</p>

<p>Brompton Grove now consists of two rows of houses, standing a
little way back from the main road, between which rows there was
a green space (1811), now occupied by shops, which range close to
the footway, and have a street, called Grove Place, in the
centre.</p>
<p><i>Upper Brompton Grove</i>, or that division of the Grove
nearest London, consists of seven houses, of which No. 4 <!--
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>was the abode of Major Shadwell Clerke, who has
reflected literary lustre upon the &lsquo;United Service,&rsquo;
by the able and judicious manner in which he conducted for so
many years the periodical journal distinguished by that
name.&nbsp; Major Clerke died 19th April, 1849.</p>
<p><i>Lower Brompton Grove</i> consisted of three houses only in
1844, numbered 8, 9, and 10; the 11 of former days being of
superior size, and once known as &ldquo;Grove House.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The 12, which stood a considerable way behind it, as the
&ldquo;Hermitage,&rdquo; and the 13, as the &ldquo;House next to
the Bunch of Grapes,&rdquo; all of which, except No. 8, claim a
passing remark.</p>
<p>In No. 9, where he had long resided, died, on the 12th of
August, 1842, Mr. John Sidney Hawkins, at the age of
eighty-five.&nbsp; He was the eldest son of Sir John Hawkins, the
well-known author of the &lsquo;History of Music,&rsquo; and one
of the biographers of Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; Mr. Hawkins was brother
of Letitia Matilda Hawkins, the popular authoress, and a lady of
whom the elder Disraeli once remarked, that she was &ldquo;the
redeeming genius of her family.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hawkins,
however, was an antiquary of considerable learning, research, and
industry; but his temper was sour and jealous, and, throughout
his whole and long literary career, from 1782 to 1814, he appears
to have been embroiled in trifling disputes and immaterial
vindications of his father or himself.</p>
<p>No. 10 Brompton Grove, now occupied by the &ldquo;Sisters of
Compassion,&rdquo; was the residence of James Petit Andrews,
Esq., younger brother of Sir Joseph Andrews, Bart., and one of
the magistrates of Queen Square Police Office; a <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>gentleman remarkable for his humane feelings as well as
for his literary taste.&nbsp; His exertions, following up those
of Jonas Hanway, were the occasion of procuring an Act of
Parliament in favour of chimney-sweep apprentices.&nbsp; Mr.
Andrews was the author of a volume of ancient and modern
anecdotes in 1789, to which a supplemental volume appeared the
following year.&nbsp; He also published a &lsquo;History of Great
Britain, connected with the Chronology of Europe;&rsquo; <a

died, on the 6th of August, 1797.</p>
<p>Grove House (called in 1809 and 1810, as already mentioned,
No. 11 Brompton Grove), was, for many years, the residence of Sir
John Macpherson, Bart.; and here he died, at an advanced age, on
the 12th of January, 1821.</p>

<p>In 1781 he was appointed Member of the Supreme Council of
Bengal, and when proceeding to the East Indies, in the
&lsquo;Valentine,&rsquo; Indiaman, distinguished himself in an
action with the French fleet in Praya Bay.&nbsp; Sir John, who
was a very large man, to encourage the sailors to stand to their
guns, promised and paid them from his own pocket five guineas a
man, which, coupled with his bravery during the action, so
pleased the seamen, that one of <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>them swore
&ldquo;his soul must be as big as his body,&rdquo; and the jokes
occasioned by this burst of feeling terminated only with Sir John
Macpherson&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fine soles!&mdash;soles, a
match for Macpherson&rsquo;s!&rdquo; was a Brompton
fishmonger&rsquo;s greeting to Sir John, etc.&nbsp; In the
neighbourhood of Brompton he was known by the <i>sobriquet</i> of
&ldquo;the Gentle Giant,&rdquo; from his usually riding a very
small pony, flourishing in the most determined manner a huge oak
stick over the little animal&rsquo;s head, but, of course, never
touching it with his club.</p>
<p>Upon the after-dinner conversation at Grove House of Mr. Hugh
Boyd rests chiefly that gentleman&rsquo;s claim to be considered
as one of the many authors of &lsquo;Junius.&rsquo;&nbsp; His
host, having temporarily retired from table, Boyd&rsquo;s words
were, &ldquo;that Sir John Macpherson little knew he was
entertaining in his mansion a political writer, whose sentiments
were once the occasion of a chivalrous appeal from Sir John to
arms,&rdquo;&mdash;immediately adding, &ldquo;<i>I am the author
of &lsquo;Junius</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The will of Sir John
Macpherson is a remarkable document, and contains the following
tribute to the character of George IV.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I conclude this, my last will and
testament, in expressing my early and unalterable admiration of
his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the truly glorious
reigning prince of the British empire; and I request my executors
to wait upon his royal highness immediately after my decease, and
to state to him, as I do now, that I have bequeathed to his royal
highness my celebrated antique statue of Minerva, which he often
admired, with any one of my antique rings that would please his
royal highness.&nbsp; I likewise request you to assure his royal
highness that I will leave him certain papers, which prove to a
demonstration that the glorious system which he has realised for
his country and the world, in his difficult reign of eight years,
was the early system of his heart and his ambition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grove House was afterwards occupied by Mr. Wilberforce, who,
in his diary of the 2nd of July, 1823, notes, &ldquo;Took
possession of our new house at Brompton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilberforce remained there about a year, and his successor
in the tenancy was Mr. Jerdan, the agreeable and well-known
editor of the &lsquo;Literary Gazette&rsquo;
(1817&ndash;50).&nbsp; This house, pulled down in 1846, stood
upon the ground which now forms the road entrance to Ovington
Square.</p>
<p>A narrow lane, which ran down by the west side of Grove House,
led to the Hermitage, a retreat of the much admired Madame
Catalani during her sojourn this country, and subsequently
converted into an asylum for insane persons.&nbsp; This building
was pulled down in 1844, and Grove Place has been erected on its
site.</p>

</a>While residing here, he was engaged in contributing to and
editing a short-lived weekly paper, entitled the &lsquo;Literary
Register,&rsquo; the first number of which appeared on the 6th of
July, 1822, and which publication terminated with the
forty-fourth, on the 3rd of May, 1823, when Banim devoted his
attention to preparing the &lsquo;Tales of the O&rsquo;Hara
Family&rsquo; for the press.&nbsp; It is a remarkable local
coincidence, that Gerald Griffin, who</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To his own mind had lived a
mystery,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the contemporary rival of Banim, as an Irish novelist and
dramatist, should have immediately succeeded him in the tenancy
of &ldquo;13 Brompton Grove,&rdquo; as this house was sometimes
called.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;About this period (1825) he [Griffin] took
quiet, retired lodgings, at a house at Brompton, now a
stonemason&rsquo;s, close by Hermitage Lane, which separated it
from the then residence of the editor of the &lsquo;Literary
Gazette,&rsquo; and a literary intercourse rather than a personal
intimacy, though of a most agreeable nature, grew up between
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"

</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>On the 10th of November, 1824, Griffin, writing to his
brother, commences a letter full of literary gossip
with,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since my last I have visited Mr. J---
several times.&nbsp; The last time, he wished me to dine with
him, which I happened not to be able to do; and was very sorry
for it, for his acquaintance is to me a matter of great
importance, not only from the engine he wields&mdash;and a
formidable one it is, being the most widely-circulated journal in
Europe&mdash;but, also, because he is acquainted with all the
principal literary characters of the day, and a very pleasant
kind of man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the honest support of the &lsquo;Literary Gazette&rsquo; at
this critical period in Griffin&rsquo;s life may be ascribed the
struggle which he made for fame and fortune through the blind
path of literary distinction.&nbsp; He came a raw Irish lad to
the metropolis, with indistinct visions of celebrity floating
through his poetical mind; or, as he candidly confesses
himself,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A young gentleman, totally unknown, even to
a single family in London, with a few pounds in one pocket and a
brace of tragedies in the other, supposing that the one will set
him up before the others are exhausted,&rdquo; which, he admits,
&ldquo;is not a very novel, but a very laughable,
delusion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Banim&rsquo;s kindness&mdash;his sympathy, indeed, for
Griffin, deserves notice.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you here,&rdquo; writes the
latter, &ldquo;the many, many instances in which Banim has shown
his friendship since I wrote last; let it suffice to say, that he
is the sincerest, heartiest, most disinterested being that
breathes.&nbsp; His fireside is the only one where I enjoy
anything like social life or home.&nbsp; I go out (to Brompton
Grove) occasionally in an evening, and talk or read for some
hours, or have a bed, and leave next day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, in a letter dated 31st of March, 1824, Griffin
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span

had not found Banim?&nbsp; I should have instantly despaired on

talking about and thinking of Banim.&nbsp; Mark me! he is a man,
the only one I have met since I left Ireland, almost.&nbsp; We
walked over Hyde Park together on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, and
renewed our home recollections by gathering shamrocks, and
placing them in our hats, even under the eye of John

<p><span class="smcap">Brompton Square</span> is opposite to the
commencement of Michael&rsquo;s Place, to which it will be
necessary to return, after a visit to the square.</p>
<p>At No. 6 has lived Mr. John Baldwin Buckstone, the
actor-author, or author-actor, so well known and esteemed by the
public.&nbsp; And at No. 14 has resided Mr. Edward Fitzwilliam,
the musical composer, who died on the 19th of January, 1857, at
the early age of 33.</p>
<p>No. 21 was, between the years 1829 and 1833, the residence of
Spagnoletti, the leader of the Opera band.&nbsp; He was succeeded
in the tenancy by Mrs. Chatterly, a lively and accomplished
actress, who continued to occupy the same house after her
marriage with Mr. Francis Place.</p>

</a>At No. 22 (which now belongs to the well-known and much
respected actor Mr. James Vining, and is at present tenanted by
Mr. Shirley Brooks) George Colman the younger died on the 26th of
October, 1836, at the age of 74, having removed to this house
from No. 5 Melina Place, Kent Road.&nbsp; &ldquo;He ceased to
exist on the 17th of October, <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>1836,&rdquo;
says his medical attendant, in a letter published in the memoirs
of the Colman family.&nbsp; But this is an error, as on the 19th
of October he appears to have written to Mr. Bunn.&nbsp; The last
earthly struggle of George Colman has been thus
described:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It has never fallen to my lot to witness in
the hour of death so much serenity of mind, such perfect
philosophy, or resignation more complete.&nbsp; Up to within an
hour of his decease he was perfectly sensible of his danger, and
bore excruciating pain with the utmost fortitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one period of his life a more popular man was not in
existence,&rdquo; observes Mr. Bunn; &ldquo;for the festive board
of the prince or the peer was incomplete without Mr.
Colman.&nbsp; He has left behind him a perpetuity of fame in his
dramatic works; and much is it to be lamented that no chronicle
has been preserved of his various and most extraordinary
<i>jeux-d&rsquo;esprit</i>.&nbsp; He has, moreover, left behind
quite enough of renown, could he lay claim to none other, to be
found in the following tribute from the pen of Lord
Byron:&mdash;&lsquo;I have met George Colman occasionally, and
thought him extremely pleasant and convivial.&nbsp;
Sheridan&rsquo;s humour, or rather wit, was always saturnine, and
sometimes savage; he never laughed (at least that I saw and I
have watched him), but Colman did.&nbsp; If I had to
<i>choose</i>, and could not have both at a time, I should say,
let me begin the evening with Sheridan, and finish it with
Colman.&nbsp; Sheridan for dinner, Colman for supper.&nbsp;
Sheridan for claret or port, but Colman for everything, from the
madeira and champagne at dinner, the claret with a layer of port
between the glasses, up to the punch of the night, and down to
the grog or gin-and-water of daybreak.&nbsp; Sheridan was a
grenadier company of life-guards, but Colman a whole
regiment&mdash;of light infantry, to be sure, but still a
regiment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sale of Colman&rsquo;s effects took place on the 29th of
November, 1837; among the pictures sold was the well-known
portrait of George Colman the elder, by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
which has been engraved; another by Gainsborough, also engraved;
a third in crayons, by Rosalba; <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and a fourth
by Zoffani, which formerly belonged to Garrick, a highly-finished
miniature of Shakspeare, by Ozias Humphrey, executed in 1784 (a
copy of which, made for the Duchess of Chandos, sold at her sale
for &pound;40); some watercolour drawings, by Emery, Mrs. Terry,
and others; some engravings; more than 1,000 volumes of French
and English books; and a collection of miscellanies, including
the MSS. of the elder Colman&rsquo;s most admired productions,
and several by George Colman the younger,&mdash;amounting in all
to twenty-six pieces.&nbsp; John Reeve bought largely of the
books; but before two months had elapsed Reeve himself was no
more.</p>
<p>No. 23 Brompton Square is occupied by Mr. William Farren, who
was for a long period the unrivalled representative of old men
upon the stage, <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> and who took his farewell at the
Haymarket Theatre in 1855; and No. 24, between the years 1840 and
1843, was the residence of Mr. Payne Collier, who has given to
the public several editions of Shakspeare, and who has been long
distinguished by his profound knowledge of dramatic literature
and history, and his extensive acquaintance with the early poetry
of England.</p>
<p>Mr. Collier&rsquo;s house, in Brompton Square, stood between
that which Mr. William Farren occupies, and one (No. 25) of which
Mr. Farren was proprietor, and has now been sold.&nbsp; At No. 28
resides Mr. William Frogatt Robson, Solicitor and Comptroller of
Droits of Admiralty.&nbsp; Mr. William <!-- page 54--><a

resided at No. 30, next door to Mr. Henry Luttrell (No. 31),
&ldquo;the great London wit,&rdquo; as Sir Walter Scott terms
him, well known in the circles of literature as the author of
many epigrams, and of a volume of graceful poetry, entitled
&lsquo;Advice to Julia,&rsquo; and who died on 19th December,
1851, aged 86.</p>
<p>In addition to these literary and dramatic associations of
Brompton Square, Liston resided for some time at No. 40, Mr.
Yates and Mr. John Reeve at 57 and 58; and that pair of comic

Church, is the Oratory of St. Philip Neri, a Roman Catholic
Establishment of considerable extent, which stands on the ground
once occupied by Mr. Pollard&rsquo;s school.&nbsp; It was opened
on 22nd March, 1851, and was originally located in King William
Street, Strand.&nbsp; It is bounded on the east by the avenue of
lime trees leading up to Holy Trinity Church, on the north by its
cemetery, on the west by the South Kensington Museum, and on the
south by the road, which has been widened by the commissioners to
eighty feet.&nbsp; The superior in <!-- page 59--><a

derived from the Exhibition of 1851.&nbsp; It was opened on the
24th June, 1857, and is a result of the School of Design, founded
at Somerset House in 1838.&nbsp; It is the head-quarters of the
Government Department of Science and Art, previously deposited in
Marlborough House, which is under the management <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>of
Mr. Henry Cole.&nbsp; The collections are temporarily placed in a
range of boiler-roofed buildings, hence the term &ldquo;Brompton
boilers&rdquo; has been applied to them.&nbsp; There are
specimens here of ornamental art, an architectural, trade, and
economical museum; a court of modern sculpture, and the gallery
of British Art, founded on the munificent gift of Mr. John
Sheepshanks.&nbsp; Mr. Sheepshanks having bestowed on the nation
a collection of 234 oil paintings, mostly by modern British
artists, and some drawings, etc., the whole formed by himself,
including some of the most popular works of Wilkie, Mulready, Sir
Edwin Landseer, Leslie, and other eminent artists of the English
school.&nbsp; To these have been since added, in several large
rooms, the Turner Collection, and the pictures from the Vernon
Gallery; also the collection bequeathed to the nation by the late
Mr. Jacob Bell, and the pictures by British artists removed from
the National Gallery; all which are well lighted from the
roof.&nbsp; The objects of ornamental art consist of medieval
furniture and decoration, painted glass, plaster casts,
electrotype copies, photographs, engravings, and drawings, etc.,
the whole designed with the view of aiding general education, and
of diffusing among all classes those principles of science and
art which are calculated to advance the individual interests of
the country, and to elevate the character of the people:
facilities are afforded for taking copies of objects upon
application at the Art Library.&nbsp; The Educational collections
formed by the Government, which are in the central portion of the
building, comprise specimens of scientific instruments, objects
of natural history, models, casts, and a <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>library;
refreshment and waiting rooms are provided; and there are
lectures delivered in a building devoted to that purpose.&nbsp;
The admission, which is from ten till four, five or six,
according to the season, is free on Monday, Tuesday, and
Saturday, also on Monday and Tuesday evening, from seven till
ten, when the galleries are lighted; on Wednesday, Thursday, and
Friday, being students&rsquo; days, the admission is 6d.</p>
<p>In form the building is rectangular, the centre or nave is 42
feet wide, and is open from the floor to the roof.&nbsp; Along
the aisles galleries run, access to which is obtained by two
large central staircases at the ends of the building, which is
for the most part lighted from the roofs.&nbsp; There is ample
ventilation, and by means of hot water pipes, the building is
heated when required.&nbsp; The exhibition space in floor and
galleries is nearly one acre and a half, exclusive of the wall
space in the galleries and aisles.&nbsp; The arrangement, it may
be seen from this description, is much the same as that adopted
in the Great Exhibition of 1851.&nbsp; There are separate
catalogues for each department to be had, which give the visitor
all necessary information.&nbsp; The building was constructed
from designs and drawings prepared by Messrs. Charles D. Young
and Co. of Great George Street, Westminster.&nbsp; Opposite the
Museum is Thurloe Place.&nbsp; No. 1 may be mentioned as the
residence of Mr. Henry Holl, well known some years ago as the
light comedian of the Haymarket Theatre.&nbsp; That gentleman has
now retired from the profession, but in addition to some dramatic
productions written many years since, he is the author of two or
three successful pieces recently produced.&nbsp; It is not the
intention <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span

<p>To return to the continuation of <span
class="smcap">Michael&rsquo;s Place</span>.&nbsp; It is divided
between Nos. 11 and 12 by <span class="smcap">Michael&rsquo;s
Grove</span>, which led to Brompton Grange, for some years the
seat of the favourite veteran vocalist, Braham, who made his
appearance as a public singer at the age of ten years, and so far
back as 1787.&nbsp; The Grange was taken down in October 1843,
and, in the course of twelve months, its spacious grounds were
covered by a decided crescent and other buildings.&nbsp; Brompton
Grange, which was constructed by Novosielski for his own
residence, was, previous to Mr. Braham&rsquo;s tenancy, occupied
by a gentleman of large fortune and weak nerves, which were most
painfully affected by the tone of a bell.&nbsp; After
considerable research, this spot was selected for his London
residence, in the belief that there he would be secure from
annoyance.&nbsp; But the folly of human anticipation was speedily
illustrated by the building of Brompton Church on the north side
of his abode, and of Chelsea New Church on the west; so that,
whatever way the wind blew,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The sound of the church-going
bell&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>was certain of being wafted to the Grange, which was got
rid of in consequence.</p>
<p>From Michael&rsquo;s Grove, <span class="smcap">Brompton
Crescent</span> is nearly a straight row of twenty-five houses,
and forms an angle to the line of the main Fulham Road, uniting
with Michael&rsquo;s Place at &ldquo;Crescent House,&rdquo; where
the carriage communication was formerly interrupted by a bar, in
place of which a post supporting two lamps is now
substituted.</p>
<p>No. 9 was for some time in the occupation of Dr. Oswald Wood,
the translator (1835) of Von Hammer&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of the
Assassins,&rsquo; and who died at the early age of thirty-eight,
on the 5th of November, 1842, in the West Indies, where he held
the appointment of Provost-Marshal of Antigua.</p>
<p>At No. 13 Brompton Crescent resided Charles Incledon, the
rival of his neighbour Braham, whose singing he was wont to
designate as &ldquo;Italianised humbug;&rdquo; declaring that no
one but himself, Charles Incledon, knew how to sing a British
ballad: and it must be admitted, that &ldquo;The Storm&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Black-eyed Susan,&rdquo; as sung by Incledon, produced a
deep impression on the public mind.&nbsp; He was a native of
Cornwall, and the son of a medical gentleman.&nbsp; As a
chorister, under the tuition of Jackson, in Exeter Cathedral,
Incledon acquired his knowledge of music; for when he was fifteen
he entered the Royal Navy, in which he served in the West Indies
from 1779 to 1783, when he abandoned the naval profession, and
joined a theatrical company at Southampton.&nbsp; After a popular
professional career of upwards of forty years as a public singer,
Incledon died at Worcester, on the 11th of February, 1826.</p>
<p>Of Incledon many amusing anecdotes are told, chiefly <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>caused by his inordinate vanity, and his mental
singleness of purpose.&nbsp; He thought of no one but himself; he
saw nothing beyond the one and immediate object at which he
grasped; and yet these faults were caused rather by natural
weakness of intellect than by an unkind or selfish
disposition.&nbsp; In fact, Incledon lived and died a petted
servant of the public; which administered intoxicating draughts
of applause to his self-esteem.</p>
<p>Mr. G. Rodwell, already mentioned as having been an inhabitant
of No. 14 Brompton Row, resided at No. 15 Brompton Crescent, in
1830.</p>
<p>No. 20 Brompton Crescent was, between the years 1822 and 1844,
occupied by Mr. Planch&eacute;, well known as, perhaps, the most
prolific and skilful dramatic writer of the day, and as a
gentleman of high literary and antiquarian attainments.&nbsp; His
connexion with the last musical efforts of the German composer
Weber, in his opera of &lsquo;Oberon,&rsquo; which was produced
at Covent Garden on the 12th of May, 1826, <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a> cannot be forgotten; and to
Planch&eacute;&rsquo;s knowledge of costume and taste for
pictorial effects the English stage is deeply indebted.&nbsp; In
the drawing-room of this house have some of our most agreeable
acting dramas been composed, and nothing could have been, in its
style and appointments, more typical of Planch&eacute;&rsquo;s
dialogue than was the apartment&mdash;smart and neat, fit for all
occasions, and suited in a moment to the present purpose,
whatever that might be.&nbsp; It was polished and elegant; but
there was nothing superfluous, beyond a bit of exquisite china on
the <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>mantel-piece, or a picture, excellent in its way, on the
wall; something which pleased the eye, and which the mind
received and relished like a nicely-pointed joke.&nbsp; A
well-painted portrait of Planch&eacute; himself, by Briggs, the
Royal Academician, which has been engraved, hung opposite to the
fireplace; and, as if to carry out the similitude between
Planch&eacute;&rsquo;s writings and the place where they were
written, folding-doors revealed a back drawing-room, which, like
his memory, was richly stored with the works of heralds and
antiquaries, and of our elder dramatists and poets, so
judiciously arranged, that in a moment he was certain of
producing the precise passage or the effect which he
desired.&nbsp; At the same time so completely was this little
battery of knowledge masked under quaint bindings and tasteful
covers, that no one suspected what a mine of learning lay
beneath; nor, like his own mental resources, was a volume
displayed without cause, or unclasped without its effect.</p>
<p>Speaking earnestly to Planch&eacute; respecting the pains and
pleasures of authorship, L. E. L. once said, &ldquo;I would give
this moment all the fame of what I have written, or ever shall
write, for one roar of applause from a crowded house, such as you
must have heard a thousand times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Planch&eacute; afterwards removed to a new and detached
house, built on the site of Brompton Grange.&nbsp; He has now
quitted the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Mr. C. J. Richardson, an architect, whose publications
illustrative of Tudor architecture and domestic English
antiquities have materially tended to diffuse a feeling of
respect for the works of our ancestors, and to forward the
growing desire to preserve and restore edifices which time <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>and circumstances have spared to the country, has
resided at No. 22 Brompton Crescent.&nbsp; At No. 28 in this
crescent, Mrs. Liston died in 1854.</p>
<p>The continuation of <span class="smcap">Michael&rsquo;s
Place</span>, which we left on our right to visit Michael&rsquo;s
Grove and Brompton Crescent, is the corner house, now Dr.
Cahill&rsquo;s and Mr. Hewett&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At No. 12, Lewis
Schiavonetti, a distinguished engraver, died on the 7th of June,
1810, at the age of fifty-five.&nbsp; He was a native of Bassano,
in the Venetian territory, and the eldest son of a stationer,
whose large family and moderate circumstances made him gladly
accept the offer of Julius Golini, a painter of some repute, to
receive his son, at the age of thirteen, for instruction in the
arts.&nbsp;

</a>In three years after, Golini expired in the arms of his
youthful pupil.&nbsp; Upon the death of his master he determined
to seek the patronage of Count Remaudini, who had given
employment to Bartolozzi and Volpato, and began to study the
mechanical process of engraving, under a poor man named Lorio,
who, unable to support himself by his profession, officiated as
sacristan to a church, and could offer him no better
accommodation for study than the sacristy.&nbsp; The
circumstances of Schiavonetti not permitting him to seek for
higher instruction, he <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>remained with this master about
twelve months, when, finding that he had learned all that poor
Lorio was able to teach, and feeling an aversion to work
occasionally among dead bodies, he determined to alter his
situation.&nbsp; A copy of a &lsquo;Holy Family,&rsquo; from
Bartolozzi, after Carlo Maratta, gained Schiavonetti immediate
employment from Count Remaudini, and attracted the notice of
Suntach, an engraver and printseller in opposition to
Remaudini.</p>
<p>About this time there came to Bassano a Mr. Testolini, of
Vicenza, a wretched engraver of architecture, but a man of
consummate craft and address.&nbsp; He became acquainted with
Schiavonetti at Suntach&rsquo;s, and, finding in his genius and
tractable disposition, a tool which he could use to great
advantage, he engaged him to work at his house.&nbsp;
Bartolozzi&rsquo;s engravings in the chalk manner were then in
great repute at Bassano, and Testolini made several abortive
attempts to discover the process.&nbsp; His young friend
succeeded better, and imitated several of Bartolozzi&rsquo;s
prints to perfection; and Testolini took some of
Schiavonetti&rsquo;s productions to the son of Bartolozzi at
Venice, and passed them off as his own.&nbsp; They gained him an
introduction to that artist, and an invitation to London, where
he was then in full occupation, and his works highly
appreciated.&nbsp; The change of climate seems to have
deteriorated the talents of Testolini; but such was his
adroitness that he gained a complete ascendancy over the easy
temper of Bartolozzi, and lived in his house at North End,
Fulham, about three years.&nbsp; During that time, finding that
yet more important advantages might be derived from the aid of
his former friend, he made several propositions to Schiavonetti
to come <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>to London.&nbsp; These were for a
time declined: the rising fame of the young artist caused his
talents to be better appreciated, and some Venetian noblemen
offered him a pension and constant employment if he would abandon
his proposed emigration.&nbsp; Testolini, to frustrate this,
induced Bartolozzi to write a letter of persuasion, partly
dictated by himself; and, confident of its effect, he set out for
Italy to bring Schiavonetti over.&nbsp; During his absence
Bartolozzi gained an insight into his real character and
interested views, and, on his return with his
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, told him that his house was no
longer open to him, but that Schiavonetti was welcome to consider
it his home.&nbsp; Testolini, however, having found a house in
Sloane Square, soon persuaded Schiavonetti that it would be
better for him to follow his fortune than to remain with
Bartolozzi, to which Schiavonetti consented.&nbsp; This
circumstance terminated the connexion between Bartolozzi and
Schiavonetti; and shortly after the reputation of the latter as
an engraver became established in London, where he conducted
every transaction he was engaged in with an uprightness and
integrity that cause his memory to be equally respected as a
gentleman and as an artist.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Madre
Dolorosa,&rsquo; after Vandyke; the portrait of that master in

Phillips; the &lsquo;Landing of the British troops in
Egypt,&rsquo; from De Loutherbourg; and the etching of the
&lsquo;Canterbury Pilgrims,&rsquo; from Stothard&rsquo;s admired
picture, are some of the most esteemed works of Lewis
Schiavonetti.&nbsp; <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span

14th June 1810, from Michael&rsquo;s Place, was attended by West,
the president, Phillips, Tresham, and other members of the Royal
Academy, by his countryman Vendramini, and almost all the
distinguished engravers of the day, with other artists and
friends to art.</p>
<p>The greater portion of No. 13, Michael&rsquo;s Place, is shown
in the sketch of No. 12, and the former may be mentioned as the
residence of the widow of the builder, Madame Novosielski, who
died here on the 30th November, 1820.&nbsp; This was the address
of Miss Helen Faucit, immediately previous to her successful
appearance in the English drama before a French audience, and is

<p>Miss Pope, an actress of considerable reputation, died at No.
17, Michael&rsquo;s Place, on the 30th July, 1818, aged
seventy-five.&nbsp; Her talents had been cultivated by the
celebrated Mrs. Clive, and she was distinguished by the notice of
Garrick.&nbsp; As a representative of old women, Miss Pope is
said to have been unrivalled; and, for more than half a century,
she remained constant to the boards of Drury Lane Theatre, never
having performed at any other with the exception of a season at
Dublin and another at Liverpool.</p>

<p>Mr. Yates, the manager of the Adelphi Theatre, and an actor of
considerable and varied powers, resided at No. 21,
Michael&rsquo;s Place, immediately previous to his accepting a
short engagement in Ireland, where he ruptured a blood-vessel,
and returned to England in so weak a state that he died on the
21st June, 1842, a few days after his arrival at the Euston
Hotel, Euston Square, from whence it was considered, when he
reached London, imprudent to remove him to Brompton.&nbsp; He was
in the forty-fifth year of his age, and made his first appearance
in London at Covent Garden on the 7th November, 1818.&nbsp; On
the 30th November, 1823, Mr. Yates married Miss Brunton, an
exemplary woman and an accomplished actress, who had retired from
the profession for some years previous to her death, aged 61, on
30th August, 1860.&nbsp; Before Mr. Yates&rsquo; tenancy, No. 21
was the residence of Mr. Liston, whose comic humour will long be
remembered on the stage.</p>
<p>Mrs. Davenport, a clever actress and an admirable
representative of old women, died at No. 22, on 8th May, 1843,

from the stage, after an uninterrupted service of thirty-six
years at Covent Garden Theatre, where she took her &ldquo;first,

&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No. 25, Michael&rsquo;s Place, may be pointed out as the house

<p>At No. 33 died Madame Delille, in 1857, at an advanced
age.&nbsp; This lady was the mother of the late Mr. C. J.
Delille, professor of the French language in Christ&rsquo;s
Hospital and in the City of London School, and French examiner in
the University of London.&nbsp; Mr. Delille&rsquo;s French
Grammar is universally adopted by schools, in addition to his

Fran&ccedil;aise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ground upon which Michael&rsquo;s Place and Brompton
Crescent are built was known by the name of &ldquo;Flounder
Field,&rdquo; from its usual moist and muddy state.&nbsp; This
field contained fourteen acres, and is said to have been part of
the estate of Alderman Henry Smith, which in this neighbourhood
was upwards of eighty-four acres.&nbsp; He was a native of
Wandsworth, where he is buried.&nbsp; It has been asserted that,
from very humble circumstances, he rose to be an alderman of
London&mdash;from circumstances so humble, indeed, that Salmon,
in his &lsquo;Antiquities of Surrey,&rsquo; mentions that he had
been in early life whipped out of Mitcham parish for begging
there.&nbsp; Being a widower, and without children, he made over
all his estates in 1620 to trustees for charitable purposes,
reserving out of the produce &pound;500 a-year for himself.&nbsp;
He died in 1627&ndash;8, and the intent of his will appears to
have been to divide his estate equally between the poorest of his
kindred, and in case <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>of any surplus it was to be applied
to the relief and ransom of poor captives.&nbsp; Mr. Smith is
said, but we know little of the history of this benevolent and
extraordinary man, to have himself suffered a long captivity in
Algiers.&nbsp; No application having been made for many years to
redeem captives, in 1772 an act of parliament was passed
&ldquo;to enable the trustees of Henry Smith, Esq., deceased, to
apply certain sums of money to the relief of his poor kindred,
and to enable the said trustees to grant building leases of an
estate in the parishes of Kensington, Chelsea, and St.
Margaret&rsquo;s, Westminster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. 1, North Terrace, leading into Alexander Square, was for
some time the residence of the celebrated &ldquo;O.&rdquo; Smith,
who, though a great ruffian upon the stage, was in private life
remarkable for his quiet manners and his varied
attainments.&nbsp; At the end of this terrace is the Western
Grammar School.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Square</span>, on the north or
right-hand side of the main Fulham Road, between the Bell and
Horns public-house and Pelham Crescent, consists of twenty-four
houses built in the years 1827 and 1830, and divided by Alfred
Place: before each portion there is a respectable enclosure, and
behind numerous new streets, squares, and houses have been built,
extending to the Old Brompton Road.</p>
<p>No. 19, Alexander Square, was the residence of Captain
Glascock, who commanded H.M.S. Tyne, and whose pen has enriched
the nautical novel literature of England <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a> with the same racy humour which has
distinguished his <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>professional career.&nbsp; When
commanding in the Douro, some communications which Glascock had
occasion to make to the Governor of Oporto not having received
that attention which the English captain considered was due to
them, and the governor having apologised for his deafness,
Glascock replied that in future he would write to his
excellency.&nbsp; He did so, but the proceeding did not produce
the required reply.&nbsp; Glascock was then told that the
governor&rsquo;s memory was defective; so he wrote again, and two
letters remained unanswered.&nbsp; In this state of things it was
intimated to Captain Glascock by a distinguished diplomatist,
that, as his letters might not have been delivered, he ought to
write another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied that
officer; &ldquo;my letters to his excellency, as you say, might
not have been delivered, for I have had no report absolutely made
to me that they had ever reached his hands: but I will take care
this time there shall be no mistake in the delivery, for you
shall see me attach my communication to a cannonball, the report
of which I can testify to my government; and, as my gunner is a
sure shot, his excellency <i>will</i> (Glascock was an Irishman)
have my epistle delivered into his hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
intimation produced at once the desired effect of a satisfactory
reply and apology.</p>
<p>Captain Glascock was one of the inspectors under the Poor
Relief Act in Ireland.&nbsp; He died in 1847.</p>
<p>No. 24 Alexander Square is the residence of Mr. George Godwin,
the editor of the &lsquo;Builder,&rsquo; and one of the honorary
secretaries of the Art Union,&mdash;an association which has
exercised an important influence upon the progress of the fine
arts in England.&nbsp; Mr. Godwin is likewise <!-- page 75--><a

known to the public as the author of several essays which evince
considerable professional knowledge, antiquarian research, and a
fertile fancy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Admiral

</a>public-house, from whence the road proceeds in a straight
line to Little Chelsea; Marlborough Road and Keppel Street,
leading to Chelsea, branching off at each side of the
tavern.&nbsp; Since this sketch was taken, the old building has
been pulled down (1856), and a large hotel erected on the same
spot, by B. Watts, where, in addition to the usual comforts of an
inn, hot and cold baths may be had.</p>
<p>In 1818 the Admiral Keppel courted the custom of passing
travellers by a poetical appeal to the feelings of both man and
beast:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Stop, brave boys, and quench your
thirst;<br />
If you won&rsquo;t drink, your horses murst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something rural in this: the distich was painted in
very rude white letters on a small black board; and when
Keppel&rsquo;s portrait, which swung in air, like England&rsquo;s
flag, braving</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The battle and the breeze,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

this board was appended as its motto.&nbsp; Both, however, were
displaced by the march of public-house improvement; the
weather-beaten sign of the gallant admiral&rsquo;s head was
transferred to a wall of the back premises, where its
&ldquo;faded form&rdquo; might, until recently, have been
recognised; but, though the legible record has perished, <i>opus
vatum durat</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Amelia Place</span> is a row of nine
houses immediately beyond the Admiral Keppel.&nbsp; Within the
walls of the last low house in the row, and the second with a
verandah, the Right Hon. John Philpot Curran died on the 14th of
October, 1817.&nbsp; It had then a pleasant look-out upon green
fields and a nursery-garden, now occupied by Pelham
Crescent.&nbsp; Here it was, with the exception of a short
excursion to Ireland, that Curran had resided during the twelve
months previous to his death.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p76.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=
"No. 7 Amelia Place"

src="images/p76.jpg" />
</a>Curran&rsquo;s public life may be said to have terminated in
1806, when he accepted the office of Master of the Rolls in
Ireland, an appointment of &pound;5000 a year.&nbsp; This
situation he retained until 1815, when his health required a
cessation from its laborious attendance.&nbsp; Upon his
retirement from office, he &ldquo;passed through the
watering-places with the <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>season,&rdquo; and then fixed himself at No. 7, Amelia
Place, Brompton, which house has now Kettle&rsquo;s boot and shoe
warehouse built out in front.&nbsp; To no other contemporary pen
than that of the Rev. George Croly can be ascribed the following
glowing sketch of Curran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From the period in which Curran emerged
from the first struggles of an unfriended man, labouring up a
jealous profession, his history makes a part of the annals of his
country: once upon the surface, his light was always before the
eye, it never sank and was never outshone.&nbsp; With great
powers to lift himself beyond the reach of that tumultuous and
stormy agitation that must involve the movers of the public mind
in a country such as Ireland then was, he loved to cling to the
heavings of the wave; he, at least, never rose to that tranquil
elevation to which his early contemporaries had one by one
climbed; and never left the struggle till the storm had gone
down, it is to be hoped for ever.&nbsp; This was his destiny, but
it might have been his choice, and he was not without the reward,
which, to an ambitious mind conscious of its eminent powers,
might be more than equivalent to the reluctant patronage of the
throne.&nbsp; To his habits legal distinction would have been
only a bounty upon his silence; his limbs would have been
fettered by the ermine; but he had the compensation of boundless
popular honour, much respect from the higher ranks of party, much
admiration and much fear from the lower partizans.&nbsp; In
Parliament he was the assailant most dreaded; in the law-courts
he was the advocate deemed the most essential; in both he was an
object of all the more powerful passions of man but
rivalry,&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;He stood alone and shone
alone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During Curran&rsquo;s residence in Amelia Place he suffered
two slight apoplectic attacks; but he, nevertheless,
&ldquo;occasionally indulged in society, and was to his last
sparkle the most interesting, singular, and delightful of all
table companions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The forenoon he generally passed
in a solitary ramble through the neighbouring fields and gardens
(which have now disappeared), and in the evening he enjoyed the
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>conversation of a few friends; but, though the
brilliancy of his wit shone to the last, he seemed like one who
had outlived everything in life that was worth enjoying.&nbsp;
This is exemplified in Curran&rsquo;s melancholy repartee to his
medical attendant a few days before his decease.&nbsp; The doctor
remarked that his patient&rsquo;s cough was not improved.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is odd,&rdquo; remarked Curran, &ldquo;for I have
been practising all night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Thursday, the 9th of October, Curran dined abroad for the
last time with Mr. Richard (&ldquo;Gentleman&rdquo;) Jones, <a
name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a> of No. 14 Chapel Street, Grosvenor
Place, for the purpose of being introduced to George Colman
&ldquo;the Younger.&rdquo;&nbsp; The party, besides the host and
hostess, consisted of Mr. Harris and Sir William
Chatterton.&nbsp; Colman that evening was unusually brilliant,
anticipating, by apt quotation and pointed remark, almost
everything that Curran would have said.&nbsp; One comment of
Curran&rsquo;s, however, made a deep impression on all
present.&nbsp; Speaking of Lord Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fare thee
well, and if for ever,&rsquo; he observed that &ldquo;his
lordship first weeps over his wife, and then wipes his eyes with
the newspapers.&rdquo;&nbsp; He left the dinner-table early, and,
on going upstairs to coffee, either affected not to know or did
not remember George Colman&rsquo;s celebrity as a wit, and
inquired of Mrs. Jones who that Mr. Colman was?&nbsp; Mr. Harris
joined them at this moment, and apologised for his friend Colman
engrossing so much of the conversation to himself, adding, that
he was the spoiled child of society, and that even the Prince
Regent listened with attention when George Colman talked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Curran, with a <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>melancholy
smile, &ldquo;I now know who Colman is; we must both sleep in the
same bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Curran was seized with apoplexy, and
continued speechless, though in possession of his senses, till
the early part of Tuesday the 14th, when he sunk into lethargy,
and towards evening died without a struggle; so tranquil, indeed,
were the last moments of Curran, that those in the room were
unable to mark the precise time when his bright spirit passed
away from this earth.&nbsp; His age has been variously stated at
sixty-seven, sixty-eight, and seventy.</p>
<p>The first lodging which John Banim, the Irish novelist,
temporarily occupied in England (April, 1822) was in the house
where his illustrious countryman had breathed his last, and from
whence Banim removed to 13, Brompton Grove, as already
noticed.&nbsp; Banim&rsquo;s first wish, when he found himself in
England, was to visit the scene of Curran&rsquo;s death; led to
the spot by a strong feeling of patriotic admiration, and
finding, by a bill in the window, that lodgings were to be let
there, he immediately took them, &ldquo;that he might dream of
his country,&rdquo; as he energetically told the writer,
&ldquo;with the halo of Curran&rsquo;s memory around
him.&rdquo;</p>

</a>he first stone of this church was laid on the 12th October,

stands had been consecrated on the 21st November, 1812; and an
Act of Parliament, 59 George III., cap. 35, 1819, authorised the
appropriation of part of that ground for the site of building a

M&rsquo;Leod, the companion and friend of the gallant Sir Murray
Maxwell, and the author of &lsquo;A Narrative of a Voyage in
H.M.S. Alceste to the Yellow Sea, and of her Shipwreck in the

<p>Signor Carlo Rovedino, a bass singer of some reputation, also
lies buried in this churchyard.&nbsp; He was a native of Milan,
and died on the 6th of October, 1822, aged seventy-one.&nbsp; The
remains of Blanchard and Egerton, two actors of established
character, repose here side by side.&nbsp; William Blanchard was
what is termed &ldquo;a useful comedian;&rdquo; whatever part was
assigned to him, he made the most of it.&nbsp; At the age of
seventeen, he joined a provincial theatrical company at York, his
native city, and in 1800, after fourteen years of laborious
country practice, appeared at Covent Garden as Bob Acres in
&lsquo;The Rivals,&rsquo; and Crack in &lsquo;The Turnpike
Gate.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the time of his death, 9th May, 1835, he
resided at No. 1, Camera Square, Chelsea.&nbsp; Blanchard had
dined with a friend at Hammersmith, and left him to return home
about six in the evening of Tuesday.&nbsp; On the following
morning, at three o&rsquo;clock, poor Blanchard was found lying
in a ditch by the roadside, having been, as is supposed, seized
by a fit; in the course of the evening he was visited by another
attack, which was succeeded by one more violent on the Thursday,
and on the following day he expired.</p>
<p>Daniel Egerton&mdash;&ldquo;oh! kingly
Egerton&rdquo;&mdash;personified for many years on the stage of
Covent Garden all the royal personages about whom there was great
state and talk, but who had little to say for themselves.&nbsp;
He was respected <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>as being, and without doubt was, an
industrious and an honest man.&nbsp; Having saved some
hardly-earned money, Egerton entered into a theatrical
speculation with a brother actor, Mr. Abbott, and became manager
of one of the minor houses, by which he was ruined, and died in
1835, under the pressure of his misfortunes.&nbsp; His widow,
whose representations of the wild women of Scott&rsquo;s novels,
Madge Wildfire and Meg Merrilies, have distinguished her, died on
the 10th August, 1847, at Brompton, aged sixty-six, having
supported herself nobly amidst the troubles of her latter
days.&nbsp; Mrs. Egerton was the daughter of the Rev. Peter
Fisher, rector of Torrington, in Devonshire.&nbsp; She appeared
at the Bath theatre soon after the death of her father in 1803,
and in 1811 made her first appearance at Covent Garden Theatre as
Juliet.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side, a little off the main road, is Onslow
Square, which was built upon the site of the extensive house and
grounds once occupied as a lunatic asylum.&nbsp; The row of large
trees now in the centre of the square was formerly the avenue
from the main road to this house.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Cole, C.B.
lives at No. 17, Onslow Square; he is well known to the public as
a member of the Executive Committee of the Crystal Palace, a
promoter of art manufactures, and the author of numerous works
published under the <i>nom de plume</i> of &ldquo;Felix
Summerly.&rdquo;&nbsp; No. 31 is the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
Theodore Martin (better known as Miss Helen Faucit).&nbsp; At No.
34 resides Baron Marochetti, the celebrated sculptor, who settled
in England after the French revolution of February, 1848, and has
obtained high patronage here.&nbsp; At the back of the house is
<!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

the avenue of trees continues.&nbsp; W. M. Thackeray, the popular
writer, lives at No. 36, and Rear-Admiral Fitzroy, the
distinguished geographer and navigator, is at No. 38.</p>
<p>A few yards beyond Sydney Place (leading into Onslow Square),
on the opposite side of the road, is Sydney Street, leading
direct to St. Luke&rsquo;s Church, the late incumbent of which,
the Rev. Charles Kingsley, who died on 29th February, 1860, aged
78, was the father of the well-known popular writer, the Rev.
Charles Kingsley, of Eversley Rectory, Hants.&nbsp; Sydney Street
was originally called Upper Robert Street, as being the
continuation of Robert Street, Chelsea; but, under some notion of
raising its respectability, the inhabitants agreed to change the
name.&nbsp; It happened, however, that the corner house adjoining
the Fulham Road, on the western side, was occupied by a surgeon,
who imagined that the change in name might be injurious to his
practice, and he took advantage of his position to retain the old
name on his house.&nbsp; Thus for some time the street was known
by both names, but that of Upper Robert Street is now entirely
abandoned.&nbsp; The opposite corner house, No. 2, Sydney Street,
was for some years occupied by the Rev. Dr. Biber, author of the
&lsquo;Life of Pestalozzi,&rsquo; and editor and proprietor of
the &lsquo;John Bull&rsquo; newspaper.&nbsp; On his selling the
&lsquo;John Bull,&rsquo; it became incorporated with the
&lsquo;Britannia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No. 24 was for some time the residence of Mr. Thomas Wright,
the well-known antiquary and historical writer, who now lives at
No. 14.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert Street</span>, which connects the
main Fulham Road <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>with the King&rsquo;s Road, passes
directly before the west side of the spacious burial-ground, and
immediately opposite to the tower of St. Luke&rsquo;s Church; at
No. 17 formerly resided Mr. Henry Warren, the President of the
New Society of Water-Colour Painters.</p>
<p>Returning to the main Fulham Road, and passing the Cancer
Hospital, now in course of erection, we come to <span
class="smcap">York Place</span>, a row of twenty-two well-built
and respectable houses on the south, or, according to our course,
left-hand side of the road.</p>
<p>No. 15, York Place, was, between the years 1813 and 1821, the
retirement of Francis Hargrave, a laborious literary barrister,
and the editor of &lsquo;A Collection of State Trials,&rsquo; <a
name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a> and many other esteemed legal
works.&nbsp; Here he died on the 16th of August, 1821, at the age
of eighty-one.</p>
<p>In 1813, when obliged to abandon his arduous profession, in
consequence of over-mental excitement, the sum of &pound;8,000
was voted by Parliament, upon the motion of Mr. Whitbread, for
the purchase of Mr. Hargrave&rsquo;s law books, which were
enriched with valuable notes, and for 300 MSS., to be deposited
in the library of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, for public use.&nbsp; As
documents of national historical importance may be
particularised, Mr. Hargrave&rsquo;s first publication, in 1772,
entitled &lsquo;<i>The Case of James Somerset</i>, <i>a
Negro</i>, <i>lately determined by the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench</i>, <i>wherein it is attempted to demonstrate the present
unlawfulness of Domestic Slavery in England</i>;&rsquo; his
&lsquo;<i>Three Arguments in the two causes in Chancery on the
last Will of Peter Thellusson</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, <i>with Mr.
Morgan&rsquo;s </i><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span><i>Calculation of the Accumulation
under the Trusts of the Will</i>, <i>1799</i>;&rsquo; and his
&lsquo;<i>Opinion in the Case of the Duke of Athol in respect to
the Isle of Man</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Opposite to York Place was a fine, open, airy piece of ground
to which Mr. Curtis, the eminent naturalist, removed his
botanical garden from Lambeth Marsh, as a more desirable
locality.&nbsp; Upon the south-east portion of this
nursery-ground the first stone was laid by H.R.H. Prince Albert,
on the 11th July, 1844, of an hospital for consumption and
diseases of the chest, and which was speedily surrounded by
houses on all sides; probably a circumstance not contemplated at
the time the ground was secured.</p>
<p>The botanical garden of Mr. Curtis, as a public resort for
study, was continued at Brompton until 1808, when the lease of
the land being nearly expired, Mr. Salisbury, who in 1792 became
his pupil, and in 1798 his partner in this horticultural
speculation, removed the establishment to the vacant space of
ground now inclosed between Sloane Street and Cadogan Place,
where Mr. Salisbury&rsquo;s undertaking failed.&nbsp; A plan of
the gardens there, as arranged by him, was published in the
&lsquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine&rsquo; for August, 1810. <a
name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Curtis, whose death has been already mentioned, was the
son of a tanner, and was born at Alton, in Hampshire, in
1746.&nbsp; He was bound apprentice to his grandfather, a quaker
apothecary of that town, whose house was contiguous to the Crown
Inn, where the botanical knowledge of John Lagg, the hostler,
seems to have excited rivalry in the breast of young
Curtis.&nbsp; In the course of events he <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>became
assistant to Mr. Thomas Talwin, an apothecary in Gracechurch
Street, of the same religious persuasion as his grandfather, and
succeeded Mr. Talwin in his business.&nbsp; Mr. Curtis&rsquo;s
love of botanical science, however, increased with his
knowledge.&nbsp; He connected with it the study of entomology, by
printing, in 1771, &lsquo;Instructions for Collecting and
Preserving Insects,&rsquo; and in the following year a
translation of the &lsquo;Fundamenta Entomologi&aelig;&rsquo; of
Linn&aelig;us.&nbsp; At this time he rented a very small garden
for the cultivation of British plants, &ldquo;near the Grange
Road, at the bottom of Bermondsey Street,&rdquo; and here it was
that he conceived the design of publishing his great work,
&lsquo;The Flora Londinensis.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Grange Road Garden was soon found too
small for his extensive ideas.&nbsp; He, therefore, took a larger
piece of ground in Lambeth Marsh, where he soon assembled the
largest collection of British plants ever brought together into
one place.&nbsp; But there was something uncongenial in the air
of this place, which made it extremely difficult to preserve sea
plants and many of the rare annuals which are adapted to an
elevated situation,&mdash;<i>an evil rendered worse every year by
the increased number of buildings around</i>.&nbsp; This led his
active mind, ever anxious for improvement, to inquire for a more
favourable soil and purer air.&nbsp; This, at length, he found at
Brompton.&nbsp; Here he procured a spacious territory, in which
he had the pleasure of seeing his wishes gratified to the utmost
extent of reasonable expectation.&nbsp; Here he continued to his
death;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>having, I may add, for many years previously, devoted himself
entirely to botanical pursuits.</p>
<p>To support the slow sale of &lsquo;The Flora
Londinensis,&rsquo; Mr. Curtis, about 1787, started &lsquo;The
Botanical Magazine,&rsquo; which became one of the popular
periodicals of the day, and Dr. Smith&rsquo;s and Mr.
Sowerby&rsquo;s &lsquo;English Botany&rsquo; was modelled after
it.</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Horticultural Society are endeavouring, as a body, to effect.</p>
<p>Immediately past the Hospital for Consumption is Fowlis
Terrace, a row of newly-built houses, running from the road.</p>
<p>At the corner of Church Street (on the opposite side of the
road) is an enclosure used as the burial-ground of the
Westminster Congregation of the Jews.&nbsp; There is an
inscription in Hebrew characters over the entrance, above which
is an English inscription with the date of the erection of the
building according to the Jewish computation <span
class="smcap">a.m.</span> 5576, or 1816 <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span>&nbsp; Beside it is the milestone
denoting that it is 1&frac12; mile from London.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen&rsquo;s Elm Turnpike</span>,
pulled down in 1848, was situated here, and took its name from
the tradition that Queen Elizabeth, when walking out, attended by
Lord Burleigh, <a name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a"
class="citation">[87a]</a> being overtaken by a heavy shower of
rain, found shelter here under an elm-tree.&nbsp; After the rain
was over, the queen said, &ldquo;Let this henceforward be called
The Queen&rsquo;s Tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tradition is strongly
supported by the parish records of Chelsea, as mention is made in
1586 (the 28th of Elizabeth, and probably the year of the
occurrence), of a tree situated about this spot, &ldquo;at the
end of the Duke&rsquo;s Walk,&rdquo; <a name="citation87b"></a><a
href="#footnote87b" class="citation">[87b]</a> as &ldquo;The
Queen&rsquo;s Tree,&rdquo; around which an arbour was built, or,
in other words, nine young <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>elm-trees
were planted, by one Bostocke, at the charge of the parish.&nbsp;
The first mention of &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s <i>Elm</i>,&rdquo;
occurs in 1687, ninety-nine years after her Majesty had sheltered
beneath the tree around which &ldquo;an arbour was built,&rdquo;
when the surveyors of the highway were amerced in the sum of five
pounds, &ldquo;for not sufficiently mending the highway from the
Queen Elm to the bridge, and from the Elm to Church
Lane.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a plan of Chelsea, from a survey made in
1664 by James Hamilton, and continued to 1717, a tree occupying
the spot assigned to &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s Elm,&rdquo; is
called &ldquo;The Cross Tree,&rdquo; and in the vestry minutes it
is designated as &ldquo;The High Elm,&rdquo; which latter name is
used by Sir Hans Sloane in 1727.&nbsp; Bostocke&rsquo;s arbour,
however, had the effect of giving to the cross-road the name of
&ldquo;The Nine Elms.&rdquo;&nbsp; Steele, on the 22nd June,
1711, writing to his wife, says, &ldquo;Pray, on the receipt of
this, go to the Nine Elms, and I will follow you within an
hour.&rdquo; <a name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a>&nbsp; And so late as 1805, &ldquo;The
Nine Elms, Chelsea,&rdquo; appeared as a local address in
newspaper advertisements.</p>
<p>Again let me crave indulgence for minute attention to the
changes of name; but much topographical difficulty often arises
from this cause.</p>
<p>The stump of the royal tree, with, as is asserted, its root
remaining in the ground undisturbed, a few years ago existed
squared down to the dimensions of an ordinary post, about six
feet in height and whitewashed.&nbsp; But the identity appears
questionable, although a post, not improbably fashioned out of
one of the nine elms which grew around it, stood till within the
last few years in front of a <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>public-house
named from the circumstance the Queen&rsquo;s Elm, which house
has been a little altered since the annexed sketch was made, by
the introduction of a clock between the second floor windows, and
the house adjoining has been rebuilt, overtopping it.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On the opposite or north side of the Fulham Road, some small
houses are called <span class="smcap">Selwood Place</span>, from
being built on part of the ground of &ldquo;Mr. Selwood&rsquo;s
nursery,&rdquo; which is mentioned in 1712 by Mr. Narcissus
Luttrell, of whom more hereafter, as one of the sources from
which he derived a variety of pear, cultivated by him in his
garden at Little Chelsea.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chelsea Park</span>, on the same side of
the way with the Queen&rsquo;s Elm public-house, and distant
about a furlong from it, as seen from the road, appears a noble
structure with a magnificent portico.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p89b.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=
"Chelsea Park Portico"
title=

</a>The ground now called Chelsea Park belonged, with an
extensive tract of which it formed the northern part, to the
famous Sir Thomas More, and in his time <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>was
unenclosed, and termed &ldquo;the Sand Hills.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
received the present name in 1625, when the Lord-Treasurer
Cranfield (Earl of Middlesex) surrounded with a brick wall about
thirty-two acres, which he had purchased in 1620 from Mr.
Blake.&nbsp; In 1717 Chelsea Park, which extended from the Fulham
to the King&rsquo;s Road, was estimated at forty acres, and
belonged to the Marquis of Wharton, with whom, when appointed in
1709 Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Addison went over as
Secretary.&nbsp; It subsequently became the scene of a
joint-stock company speculation under a patent granted in 1718 to
John Appletree, Esq., for producing raw silk of the growth of
England, and for raising a fund for carrying on the same.&nbsp;
This undertaking was divided into shares of &pound;5 each, of
which &pound;1 was paid down.&nbsp; Proposals were published, a
subscription-book opened, in which several hundred names were
soon entered; a deed of trust executed and enrolled in Chancery;
directors were chosen by the subscribers for managing the affairs
of the Company; and, Chelsea Park being thought a proper soil for
the purpose and in a convenient situation, a lease was taken of
it for 122 years.&nbsp; Here upwards of 2000 mulberry-trees were
soon planted, and extensive edifices erected for carrying on the
work: this number of trees was, however, but a small part of what
the company intended to plant if they were successful.&nbsp; In
the following year Mr. Henry Barham, F.R.S., who was probably a
member of the company, published &lsquo;An Essay on the Silk
Worm,&rsquo; in which he thinks &ldquo;all objections and
difficulties against this glorious undertaking are shown to be
mere phantoms and trifles.&rdquo;&nbsp; The event, however, <!--
page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>proved that the company met with difficulties of a real
and formidable nature; for though the expectation of this
gentleman, who questioned not that in the ensuing year they
should produce a considerable quantity of raw silk, may have been
partly answered, the undertaking soon began to decline, and, in
the course of a few years, came to nothing.&nbsp; It must,
however, be admitted that the violent stock-jobbing speculations
of the year 1720, which involved the shares of all projects of
this nature, might have produced many changes among the
proprietors, and contributed to derange the original
design.&nbsp; However, from that period to the present time, no
effort has been made to cultivate the silkworm in this country as
a mercantile speculation, although individuals have continued to
rear it with success as an object of curiosity.</p>
<p>Walpole, in his &lsquo;Catalogue of Engravers,&rsquo; tells us
that James Christopher Le Blon, a Fleming by birth, and a
mezzotint-engraver by profession, some time subsequent to 1732,
&ldquo;set up a project for copying the cartoons in tapestry, and
made some very fine drawings for that purpose.&nbsp; Houses were
built and looms erected in the Mulberry Ground at Chelsea; but
either the expense was precipitated too fast, or contributions
did not arrive fast enough.&nbsp; The bubble burst, several
suffered, and Le Blon was heard of no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Walpole
adds, &ldquo;It is said he died in an hospital at Paris in
1740:&rdquo; and observes that Le Blon was &ldquo;very far from
young when he knew him, but of surprising vivacity and
volubility, and with a head admirably mechanic, but an universal
projector, and with at least one of the qualities that attend
that vocation, either a dupe or a <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>cheat; I
think,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;the former, though, as most of
his projects ended in air, the sufferers believed the
latter.&nbsp; As he was much an enthusiast, perhaps like most
enthusiasts he was both one and t&rsquo; other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present mansion was built upon a portion of Chelsea Park
by Mr. William Broomfield, an eminent surgeon, who resided in it
for several years.&nbsp; The late possessor was Sir Henry Wright
Wilson, Bart., to whose wife, Lady Frances Wilson (daughter of
the Earl of Aylesbury), was left a valuable estate in Hampshire,
<a name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"
class="citation">[92]</a> said to be worth about &pound;3,000 a
year, under the following very singular circumstances.&nbsp; Her
ladyship was informed one morning in February, 1814, while at
breakfast, that an eccentric person named Wright, who had died a
few days previously at an obscure lodging in Pimlico, had
appointed her and Mr. Charles Abbott his executors, and after
some legacies had bequeathed to Lady Frances the residue of his
property by a will dated so far back as August, 1800.&nbsp; As
Lady Frances declared herself to be unacquainted even with the
name of the testator, she at first concluded that there was some
mistake in the matter.&nbsp; After further explanation, the
person of Mr. Wright was described to her, and Lady Frances at
last recollected that the description answered that of a
gentleman she had remembered as a constant frequenter of the
Opera some years previously and considered <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>to be a
foreigner, and who had annoyed her extremely there by constantly
staring at her box.&nbsp; To satisfy herself of the identity, she
went to the lodgings of the late Mr. Wright, and saw him in his
coffin, when she recognized the features perfectly as those of
the person whose eyes had so often persecuted her when she was
Lady Frances Bruce, but who had never spoken to her, and of whom
she had no other knowledge whatever.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright left legacies of &pound;4,000 to the Countess of
Rosslyn, &pound;4,000 to the Speaker of the House of Commons,
&pound;1,000 to the lord-chancellor, and the same sum to
Archdeacon Pott, the rector of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, which
church Mr. Wright had been in the habit of frequenting, having as
little acquaintance with any of these parties as he had with Lady
Frances Wilson.&nbsp; It may be supposed from these facts that
Lady Frances Wilson was exceedingly beautiful, and that an
admiration of her charms might have influenced Mr. Wright to make
this extraordinary bequest in her favour; but those who knew Lady
Frances well assert that such could not possibly have been the
case, as she was far from beautiful at any period of her life;
and the oddity of the story is, and it seemed to be the general
opinion, that Mr. Wright&rsquo;s legacy was intended for a lady
who usually occupied a box next to that in which Lady Frances
sat, and who, at the period, was regarded as the <i>belle</i> of
the Opera.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thistle Grove</span>, on the opposite side
of the road from Chelsea Park, leads, by what had been a garden
pathway, to the Old Brompton Road.&nbsp; At each side of
&ldquo;the Grove,&rdquo; now occupying the sites of trees, are
detached villas, <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>houses, lodges, and cottages, named,
or not named, after the taste of their respective proprietors;
one of which, on the left hand, some fourteen houses distant from
the main Fulham Road, was for many years the residence of Mr.
John Burke, whose laborious heraldic and genealogical inquiries
induced him to arrange and publish various important collections
relative to the peerage and family history of the United Kingdom,
in which may be found, condensed for immediate reference, an
immense mass of important information.</p>
<p>In Thistle Grove Mr. J. P. Warde, the well-known actor, died
in 1840.</p>
<p>Immediately beyond Chelsea Park the village of <span
class="smcap">Little Chelsea</span> commences, about the centre
of which, and on the same side of the way, at the corner of the
road leading to Battersea Bridge, stands the Goat in Boots
public-house.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p94.jpg">
<img class="clearcenter" alt=
"Goat in Boots"
title=
"Goat in Boots"
src="images/p94.jpg" />
</a>In 1663, there was a &ldquo;house called the Goat at Little
Chelsea,&rdquo; which, between that year and 1713, enjoyed the
<!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>right of commonage for two cows and one heifer upon
Chelsea Heath.</p>
<p>How the Goat became equipped in boots, and the designation of
the house changed, has been the subject of various conjectures;
the most probable of which is, that it originates in a corruption
of the latter part of the Dutch legend,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">mercurius is der goden
boode</span>,&rdquo;<br />
(Mercury is the messenger of the gods,)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which being divided between each side of a sign bearing the
figure of Mercury&mdash;a sign commonly used in the early part of
the last century to denote that post-horses were to be
obtained&mdash;&ldquo;der goden boode&rdquo; became freely
translated into English, &ldquo;the goat in boots.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To Le Blon is attributed the execution of this sign and its
motto; but, whoever the original artist may have been, and the
intermediate retouchers or repainters of the god, certain it is
that the pencil of Morland, in accordance with the desire of the
landlord, either transformed the petasus of Mercury into the
horned head of a goat, his talaria into spurs upon boots of huge
dimensions, and his caduceus into a cutlass, or thus decorated
the original sign, thereby liquidating a score which he had run
up here, without any other means of payment than what his pencil
afforded.&nbsp; The sign, however, has been painted over, with
considerable additional embellishments from gold leaf, so that
not the least trace of Morland&rsquo;s work remains, except,
perhaps, in the outline.</p>
<p>Park Walk (the road turning off at the Goat in Boots) proceeds
to the King&rsquo;s Road, and, although not in a direct line, to
Battersea Bridge.&nbsp; Opposite the Goat in Boots is <!-- page
96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Gilston Road, leading to Boltons and St. Mary&rsquo;s
Place.&nbsp; At No. 6, St. Mary&rsquo;s Place, resides J. O.
Halliwell, F.R.S., F.S.A., the well-known Shaksperian scholar,
whose varied contributions to literature have been crowned by the
production of his folio edition of Shakspere&mdash;a work still
in progress.&nbsp; At No. 8, Mr. Edward Wright, the popular
actor, resided for a short time.</p>
<p>A few paces further on the main Fulham Road, at the north or
opposite side, stood &ldquo;Manor House,&rdquo; now termed Manor
Hall, and occupied by St. Philip&rsquo;s Orphanage, a large,
old-fashioned building, with the intervening space between it and
the road screened in by boards,&mdash;which were attached to the
antique iron gate and railings about twenty years ago, when it
became appropriated to a charitable asylum.&nbsp; Previously,
Manor House had been a ladies&rsquo; boarding-school; and here
Miss Bartolozzi, afterwards Madame Vestris, was educated.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Seymour Place</span>, which leads to
Seymour Terrace, is a cul-de-sac on the same side of the main
Fulham Road, between Manor Hall and the Somerset Arms
public-house, which last forms the west corner of Seymour
Place.</p>
<p>At No. 1, Seymour Terrace expired, on the 19th of June, 1824,
in her twenty-fifth year, Madame Riego, the widow of the
unfortunate patriot General Riego, &ldquo;the restorer and martyr
of Spanish freedom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her short and eventful history
possesses more than ordinary melancholy.&nbsp; While yet a child
she had to endure all the hardships and privations consequent
upon a state of warfare, and under the protection of her maternal
grandfather, had to seek refuge from place to place on the
mountains of Asturias from the <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>French
army.&nbsp; At the close of 1821 she was married to General
Riego, to whom she had been known and attached almost from
infancy, and, in the spring of the following year, became, with
her distinguished husband, a resident in Madrid.&nbsp; But the
political confusion and continued alarm of the period having
appeared to affect her health, the general proceeded with her in
the autumn to Granada, where he parted from his young and beloved
wife, never again to meet her in this world, the convocation of
the extraordinary Cortes for October 1822 obliging him to return
to the capital.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the canon Riego, brother to her husband, and
her attached sister, Donna Lucie, she removed in March to Malaga,
from whence the advance of the French army into the south of
Spain obliged them to seek protection at Gibraltar, which, under
the advice of General Riego, they left for England on the 4th of
July, but, owing to an unfavourable passage, did not reach London
until the 17th of August.&nbsp; Here the visitation which
impended over her was still more calamitous than all that had
preceded it.&nbsp; Within little more than two months after her
arrival in London, the account arrived of General Riego&rsquo;s
execution. <a name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97"
class="citation">[97]</a></p>
<p>Gerald Griffin, the Irish novelist, in a letter dated 22nd of
November, 1823, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have been lately negotiating with my host
(of 76 Regent Street) for lodgings for the widow and brother of
poor General Riego.&nbsp; They <!-- page 98--><a

apartments, but the affair has been broken off by the account of
his death.&nbsp; It has been concealed from her.&nbsp; She is a
young woman, and is following him fast, being far advanced in a
consumption.&nbsp; His brother is in deep grief.&nbsp; He says he
will go and bury himself for the remainder of his days in the
woods of America.&rdquo;</p>

</a> as it was then, Seymour Terrace, Little Chelsea, as it is
now called, became, about this period, the residence of the
unhappy fugitives.&nbsp; Griffin, who appears to have made their
acquaintance through a Spanish gentleman, named Valentine Llanos,
writes, in February, 1824,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was introduced the other day to poor
Madame Riego, the relict of the unfortunate general.&nbsp; I was
surprised to see her look much better than I was prepared to
expect, as she is in a confirmed consumption.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mental grief, which death only could terminate, had at that
moment &ldquo;marked&rdquo; Madame Riego &ldquo;for his
own;&rdquo; yet her look, like that of all high-minded Spaniards,
to a stranger was calm&mdash;&ldquo;much better than he was
prepared to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 18th of May, exactly one month and a day before the
termination of her sufferings, Griffin says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The canon Riego, brother to the poor
martyr, sent me, the other day, a Spanish poem of many cantos,
having for its subject the career <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>of the
unhappy general, and expressed a wish that I might find material
for an English one in it, if I felt disposed to make anything of
the subject.&nbsp; <i>Apropos</i>, Madame Riego is almost
dead.&nbsp; The fire is in her eye, and the flush on her cheek,
which are, I believe, no beacons of hope to the
consumptive.&nbsp; She is an interesting woman, and I pity her
from my soul.&nbsp; This Mr. Mathews, who was confined with her
husband, and arrived lately in London, and who, moreover, is a
countryman of mine, brought her from her dying husband a little
favourite dog and a parrot, which were his companions in his
dungeon.&nbsp; He very indiscreetly came before her with the
remembrances without any preparation, and she received a shock
from it, from which she has not yet, nor ever will recover.&nbsp;
What affecting little circumstances these are, and how
interesting to one who has the least mingling of enthusiasm in
his character!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madame Riego died in the arms of her attached sister, attended
by the estimable canon.&nbsp; In her will she directed her
executor, the canon, to assure the British people of the
gratitude she felt towards them for the sympathy and support
which they extended to her in the hours of her adversity.&nbsp;
But what makes the will peculiarly affecting is her solemn
attestation to the purity and sincerity of the political life of
General Riego.&nbsp; She states that she esteems it to be the
last act of justice and duty to the memory of her beloved
husband, solemnly to declare, in the awful presence of her God,
before whose judgment-seat she feels she must soon appear, that
all his private feelings and dispositions respecting his country
corresponded with his public acts and professions in defence of
its liberties.</p>
<p>A few yards beyond the turn down to Seymour Place, on the
opposite side of the road, stood, until pulled down in 1856, to
make room for the new one, the additional <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>workhouse
to St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square, for which purpose
Shaftesbury House was purchased by that parish in 1787; and an
Act of Parliament passed in that year declares it to be in
&ldquo;St. George&rsquo;s parish so long as it shall continue to
be appropriated to its present use.&rdquo;&nbsp;

</a>The parochial adjuncts to Lord Shaftesbury&rsquo;s mansion,
which remained, until the period of its demolition, in nearly the
same state as when disposed of, have been considerable; but the
building, as his lordship left it, could be at once recognised
through the iron gate by which you entered, and which was
surmounted by a lion rampant, probably the crest of one of the
subsequent possessors.&nbsp; It is surprising, indeed, that so
little alteration, externally as well as internally should have
taken place.&nbsp; The appearance of the back of Shaftesbury
House, as represented in an old print, was unchanged, with the
exception of the flight of steps which led to the garden being
transferred to the west (or shaded side) of the wing&mdash;an
<!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>addition made by Lord Shaftesbury to the original
house.&nbsp; This was purchased by him in 1699 from the Bovey
family, as heirs to the widow of Sir James Smith, by whom there
is reason to believe it was built in 1635, as 
<a href="images/p101a.jpg">

</a>was engraved on a stone which formed part of the pavement in

<p>The Right Honourable Sir James Smith was buried at Chelsea
18th of November, 1681.&nbsp; He was probably the junior sheriff
of London in 1672.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It does not appear,&rdquo; says Lysons,
&ldquo;that Lord Shaftesbury pulled down Sir James Smith&rsquo;s
house, but altered it and made considerable additions by a
building fifty feet in length, which projected into the
garden.&nbsp; It was secured with an iron door, the
window-shutters were of the same metal, and there were iron
plates between it and the house to prevent all communication by
fire, of which this learned and noble peer seems to have
entertained great apprehensions.&nbsp; The whole of the new
building, though divided into a gallery and two small rooms (one
of which was his lordship&rsquo;s bedchamber), was fitted up as a
library.&nbsp; The earl was very fond of the culture of
fruit-trees, and his gardens were planted with the choicest
sorts, particularly every kind of vine which would bear the open
air of this climate.&nbsp; It appears by Lord Shaftesbury&rsquo;s
letters to Sir John Cropley that he dreaded the smoke of London
as so prejudicial to his health, that whenever <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>the wind
was easterly he quitted Little Chelsea,&rdquo; where he generally
resided during the sitting of Parliament.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1710 the noble author of &lsquo;Characteristics,&rsquo;
then about to proceed to Italy, sold his residence at Little
Chelsea to Narcissus Luttrell, Esq., who, as a book-collector, is
described by Dr. Dibdin as &ldquo;ever ardent in his love of past
learning, and not less voracious in his bibliomaniacal
appetites&rdquo; than the Duke of Marlborough.&nbsp; Sir Walter
Scott acknowledges in his preface to the works of Dryden the
obligations he is under to the &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; and
&ldquo;curious collection of fugitive pieces of the reigns of
Charles II., James II., William III., and Queen Anne,&rdquo;
&ldquo;made by Narcissus Luttrell, Esq., under whose name the
editor quotes it.&nbsp; This industrious collector,&rdquo;
continues Sir Walter, &ldquo;seems to have bought every poetical
tract, of whatever merit, which was hawked through the streets in
his time, marking carefully the price and the date of the
purchase.&nbsp; His collection contains the earliest editions of
many of our most excellent poems, bound up, according to the
order of time, with the lowest trash of Grub Street.&nbsp; It was
dispersed on Mr. Luttrell&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; adds Sir Walter
Scott, and he then mentions Mr. James Bindley and Mr. Richard
Heber as having &ldquo;obtained a great share of the Luttrell
collection, and liberally furnished him with the loan of some of
them in order to the more perfect editing of Dryden&rsquo;s
works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not exactly correct, as Mr. Luttrell&rsquo;s library
descended with Shaftesbury House to Mr. Sergeant Wynne, and from
him to his eldest son, after whose death it was sold by auction
in 1786.&nbsp; On the title-page of the <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>sale-catalogue the collection is described as
&ldquo;the valuable library of Edward Wynne, Esq., lately
deceased, brought from his house at Little Chelsea.&nbsp; Great
part of it was formed by an eminent and curious collector in the
last century.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the sale of Mr. Wynne&rsquo;s
library, Bindley purchased lot &rsquo;209, Collection of Poems,
various, Latin and English, 5 vols. 1626, &amp;c.,&rsquo; for
seven guineas; and &rsquo;211, Collection of Political Poems,
Dialogues, Funeral Elegies, Lampoons, &amp;c., with various
Political Prints and Portraits, 3 vols. 1641, &amp;c.,&rsquo; for
sixteen pounds; and it is probable that these are the collections
to which Sir Walter Scott refers.</p>
<p>Dr. Dibdin, in his enthusiastic mode of treating matters of
bibliography, endeavours to establish a pedigree for those
who</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Love a ballad in print a&rsquo;
life,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from Pepys, placing Mr. Luttrell the Second in descent.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The opening of the eighteenth
century,&rdquo; he observes, &ldquo;was distinguished by the
death of a bibliomaniac of the very first order and celebrity; of
one who had no doubt frequently discoursed largely and eloquently
with Luttrell upon the variety and value of certain editions of
old ballad poetry, and between whom presents of curious old
black-letter volumes were in all probability passing, I allude to
the famous Samuel Pepys, secretary to the Admiralty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of Narcissus Luttrell he then says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nothing would seem to have escaped his
lynx-like vigilance.&nbsp; Let the object be what it may
(especially if it related to poetry), let the volume be great or
small, or contain good, bad, or indifferent warblings of the
Muse, his insatiable craving had &lsquo;stomach for
all.&rsquo;&nbsp; We may consider his collection the
fountain-head of these copious streams, which, after fructifying
in the libraries of many bibliomaniacs in the first half of the
eighteenth century, settled for awhile more determinedly in the
curious book-reservoir of a Mr. Wynne, and hence breaking up and
taking a different direction towards the collections of <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Farmer, Steevens, and others, they have almost lost
their identity in the innumerable rivulets which now inundate the
book-world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is to the literary taste of Mr. Edward Wynne, as asserted
by Dr. Dibdin, that modern book-collectors are indebted for the
preservation of most of the choicest relics of the Bibliotheca
Luttrelliana.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Wynne,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;lived at Little Chelsea, and built his library in a room
which had the reputation of having been Locke&rsquo;s
study.&nbsp; Here he used to sit surrounded by innumerable books,
a great part being formed by &lsquo;an eminent and curious
collector in the last century.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Dr. Dibdin says respecting Mr. Wynne&rsquo;s building a
library and Locke&rsquo;s study is inaccurate, as there can be no
reasonable doubt that the room or rooms his library occupied were
those built by Lord Shaftesbury, which had (and correctly) the
reputation of having been his lordship&rsquo;s library, and the
study, not of Locke, although of Locke&rsquo;s pupil and
friend.&nbsp; It is not even probable that Lord Shaftesbury was
ever visited by our great philosopher at Little Chelsea, as from
1700 that illustrious man resided altogether at Oates, in Essex,
where he died on the 28th of October, 1704.</p>
<p>Whether to Lord Shaftesbury or to Mr. Luttrell the
embellishments of the garden of their residence are to be
attributed can now be only matter for conjecture, unless some
curious autograph-collector&rsquo;s portfolio may by chance
contain an old letter or other document to establish the
claim.&nbsp; Their tastes, however, were very similar.&nbsp; They
both loved their books, and their fruits and flowers, and enjoyed
the study of them.&nbsp;

longitudinal sections, was communicated to the Horticultural
Society by Dr. Luttrell Wynne, one hundred years after the notes
had been made, and may be found printed in the second volume of
the Transactions of that Society.&nbsp; In this account
twenty-five varieties of pears are mentioned, which had been
obtained between the years 1712 and 1717 from Mr. Duncan&rsquo;s,
Lord Cheneys&rsquo;s, Mr. Palmer&rsquo;s, and Mr. Selwood&rsquo;s
nursery.</p>
<p>Until recently it was astounding to find, amid the rage for
alteration and improvement, the formal old-fashioned shape of a
trim garden of Queen Anne&rsquo;s time carefully preserved, its
antique summer-houses respected, and the little infant leaden
Hercules, which spouted water to cool the air from a
serpent&rsquo;s throat, still asserting its aquatic supremacy,
under the shade of a fine old medlar-tree; and all this too in
the garden of a London parish workhouse!&nbsp;

<p>Narcissus Luttrell died here on the 26th of June, 1732, and
was buried at Chelsea on the 6th of July following; where Francis
Luttrell (presumed to be his son) was also buried on the 3rd of
September, 1740.&nbsp; Shaftesbury House then passed into the
occupation of Mr. Sergeant Wynne, who died on the 17th of May,
1765; and from him it descended to his eldest son, Mr. Edward
Wynne, the author of &lsquo;Eunomus: a Dialogue concerning the
Law and Constitution of England, with an Essay on
Dialogue,&rsquo; 4 vols. 8vo; and other works, chiefly of a legal
nature.&nbsp; He died a bachelor, at Little Chelsea, on the 27th
of December, 1784; and his brother, the Rev. Luttrell Wynne, of
All Souls, Oxford, inherited Shaftesbury House, <!-- page
109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>and the valuable library which Mr. Luttrell, his
father, and brother, had accumulated.&nbsp; The house he
alienated to William Virtue, from whom, as before mentioned, it
was purchased by the parish of St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover
Square, in 1787; and the library formed a twelve-days&rsquo;
sale, by Messrs. Leigh and Sotheby, commencing on the 6th of
March, 1786.&nbsp; The auction-catalogue contained 2788 lots; and
some idea of the value may be formed from the circumstance, that
nine of the first seventeen lots sold for no less a sum than
&pound;32 7s., and that four lots of old newspapers, Nos. 25, 26,
27, and 28, were knocked down at &pound;18 5s.&nbsp; No.
&lsquo;376, a collection of old plays, by Gascoigne, White,
Windet, Decker, &amp;c., 21 vols,&rsquo; brought &pound;38 17s.;
and No. 644, Milton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Eiconoclastes,&rsquo; with MS.
notes, supposed to be written by Milton, was bought by Waldron
for 2s., who afterwards gave it to Dr. Farmer.&nbsp; Dr. Dibdin
declares, that &ldquo;never was a precious collection of English
history and poetry so wretchedly detailed to the public in an
auction-catalogue&rdquo; as that of Mr. Wynne&rsquo;s library;
and yet it will be seen that it must have realised a considerable
sum of money.&nbsp; He mentions, that &ldquo;a great number of
the poetical tracts were disposed of, previous to the sale, to
Dr. Farmer, who gave not more than forty guineas for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">from little chelsea to

<p>After what has been said respecting Shaftesbury House, it may
be supposed that its associations with the memory of remarkable
individuals are exhausted.&nbsp; This is very far from being the
case; and a long period in its history, from 1635 to 1699,
remains to be filled up, which, however, must be done by
conjecture: although so many circumstances are upon record, that
it is not impossible others can be produced to complete a chain
of evidence that may establish among those who have been inmates
of the <span class="smcap">additional Workhouse of St.
George&rsquo;s</span>, <span class="smcap">Hanover
Square</span>&mdash;startling as the assertion may
appear&mdash;two of the most illustrious individuals in the
annals of this country; of one of whom Bishop Burnet observed, <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a> that his &ldquo;loss is lamented by
all learned men;&rdquo; the other, a man whose &ldquo;great and
distinguishing knowledge was the knowledge of human nature or the
powers and operations of the mind, in which he went further, and
spoke clearer, than all other writers who preceded him, and whose
&lsquo;Essay on the <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Human Understanding&rsquo; is the
best book of logic in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this, I need
scarcely add that <span class="smcap">Boyle</span> and <span
class="smcap">Locke</span> are the illustrious individuals
referred to.</p>
<p>The amiable John Evelyn, in his &lsquo;Diary,&rsquo; mentions
his visiting Mr. Boyle at Chelsea, on the 9th March, 1661, in
company &ldquo;with that excellent person and philosopher, Sir
Robert Murray,&rdquo; where they &ldquo;saw divers effects of the
eolipile for weighing air.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the same year M.
de Monconys, a French traveller in England, says,
&ldquo;L&rsquo;apr&egrave;s din&eacute; je fus avec M. Oldenburg,
<a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a> et mon fils, &agrave; deux milles de
Londres en carosse pour cinq chelins &agrave; un village
nomm&eacute; <i>le petit Chelsey</i>, voir M. Boyle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now at this period there probably was no other house at Little
Chelsea of sufficient importance to be the residence of the Hon.
Robert Boyle, where he could receive strangers in his laboratory
and show them his great telescope; and, moreover, notwithstanding
what has been said to prove the impossibility of Locke having
visited Lord Shaftesbury on this spot, local tradition continues
to assert that Locke&rsquo;s work on the &lsquo;Human
Understanding&rsquo; was commenced in the retirement of one of
the summer-houses of Lord Shaftesbury&rsquo;s residence.&nbsp;
This certainly may have been the case if we regard Locke as a
visitor to his brother philosopher, Boyle, and admit his tenancy
of the mansion previous to that of Lord Shaftesbury, to whom
Locke, it is very probable, communicated the circumstance, and
which might have indirectly led to his lordship&rsquo;s purchase
of the premises.&nbsp; Be that as it may, it is an interesting
association, with something more than mere fancy for its <!--
page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>support, to contemplate a communion between two of the
master-minds of the age, and the influence which their
conversation possibly had upon that of the other.</p>
<p>Boyle&rsquo;s sister, the puritanical Countess of Warwick,
under date 27th November, 1666, makes the following note:
&ldquo;In the morning, as soon as dressed, I prayed, then went
with my lord to my house at Chelsea, which he had hired, where I
was all that day taken up with business about my house.&rdquo; <a
name="citation112"></a><a href="#footnote112"
class="citation">[112]</a>&nbsp; Whether this refers to <i>Little
Chelsea</i> or not is more than I can affirm, although there are
reasons for thinking that Shaftesbury House, or, if not, one
which will be subsequently pointed out, is the house alluded
to.</p>
<p>Charles, the fourth Earl of Orrery, and grand-nephew to Boyle
the philosopher, was born at Dr. Whittaker&rsquo;s house at
Little Chelsea on the 21st July, 1674.&nbsp; It was his
grandfather&rsquo;s marriage with Lady Margaret Howard, daughter
of the Earl of Suffolk, that induced the witty Sir John Suckling
to write his well-known &lsquo;Ballad upon a Wedding,&rsquo; in
which he so lusciously describes the bride:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Her cheeks so rare a white was on,<br />
No daisie makes comparison;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sees them is undone;<br />
For streaks of red were mingled there,<br />
Such as are on the Cath&rsquo;rine pear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The side that&rsquo;s next the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her lips were red; and one was thin,<br />
Compared to that was next her chin&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some bee had stung it newly;<br />
But, Dick, her eyes so guard her face,<br />
I durst no more upon her gaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than on the sun in July.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>The second Earl of Orrery, this lady&rsquo;s son,
having married Lady Mary Sackville, daughter of the Earl of
Dorset, is stated to have led a secluded life at Little Chelsea,
and to have died in 1682.&nbsp; His eldest son, the third earl,
died in 1703, and his brother, mentioned above as born at Little
Chelsea, became the fourth earl, and distinguished himself in the
military, scientific, and literary proceedings of his
times.&nbsp; In compliment to this Lord Orrery&rsquo;s patronage,
Graham, an ingenious watchmaker, named after his lordship a piece
of mechanism which exhibits the movements of the heavenly
bodies.&nbsp; With his brother&rsquo;s death, however, in 1703,
at Earl&rsquo;s Court, Kensington, the connection of the Boyle
family with this neighbourhood appears to terminate.</p>
<p>Doctor Baldwin Hamey, an eminent medical practitioner during
the time of the Commonwealth, and a considerable benefactor to
the College of Physicians, died at Little Chelsea on the 14th of
May, 1676, after an honourable retirement from his professional
duties of more than ten years.</p>
<p>Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of Kensington,&rsquo;
published in 1820, and in which parish the portion of Little
Chelsea on the north side of the Fulham Road stands, mentions the
residence of Sir Bartholomew Shower, an eminent lawyer, in 1693;
Sir Edward Ward, lord chief baron of the Exchequer, in 1697;
Edward Fowler, lord bishop of Gloucester, in 1709, who died at
his house here on the 26th August, 1714; and Sir William Dawes,
lord bishop of Chester, in 1709, who, I may add, died Archbishop
of York in 1724.&nbsp; But in Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s &lsquo;History
of <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>Chelsea,&rsquo; published in 1829, nothing more is to
be found respecting Sir Bartholomew Shower than that he was
engaged in some parochial law proceedings in 1691.&nbsp; Sir
Edward Ward&rsquo;s residence is unnoticed.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Gloucester, who is said to have been a devout believer in fairies
and witchcraft, is enumerated among the inhabitants of Paradise
Row, Chelsea (near the hospital, and full a mile distant from
<i>le petit Chelsey</i>); and Sir William Dawes, we find from
various entries, an inhabitant of the parish between the years
1696 and 1712, but without &ldquo;a local habitation&rdquo; being
assigned to him.&nbsp; All this is very unsatisfactory to any one
whose appetite craves after map-like accuracy in parish
affairs.</p>
<p>Bowack, in 1705, mentions that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At Little Chelsea stands a regular handsome
house, with a noble courtyard and good gardens, built by Mr.
Mart, now inhabited by Sir John Cope, Bart., a gentleman of an
ancient and honourable family, who formerly was eminent in the
service of his country abroad, and for many years of late in
Parliament, till he voluntarily retired here to end his days in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here Sir John Cope died in 1721.&nbsp; Can he have been
the father of the</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking
yet,<br />
Or are ye sleeping, I would wit?<br />
O haste ye, get up, for the drums do beat;<br />
O fye, Cope! rise up in the morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;of the Sir John Cope who was forced to retreat from
Preston Pans in &ldquo;the &rsquo;45,&rdquo; and against whom all
the shafts of Jacobite ribaldry have been levelled?</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>Faulkner says that this house, which was
&ldquo;subsequently occupied by the late Mr. Duffield as a
private madhouse, has been pulled down, and its site is now
called Odell&rsquo;s Place, a little eastward of Lord
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s;&rdquo; that is to say, opposite to Manor
Hall, and Sir John Cope&rsquo;s house was not improbably the
residence of two distinguished naval officers, Sir James Wishart
and Sir John Balchen.&nbsp; The former was made an admiral, and
knighted by Queen Anne in 1703, and appointed one of the lords of
the Admiralty, but was dismissed from the naval service by George
I. for favouring the interests of the Pretender, and died at
Little Chelsea on the 30th of May, 1723.&nbsp; In the
&lsquo;Daily Courant,&rsquo; Monday, July 15, 1723, the following
advertisement appears:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To be sold by auction, the household goods,
plate, china ware, linen, &amp;c., of Sir James Wishart,
deceased, on Thursday the 18th instant, at his late
dwelling-house at Little Chelsea.&nbsp; The goods to be seen this
day, to-morrow, and Wednesday, before the sale, from 9 to 12 in
the morning, and from 3 to 7 in the evening.&nbsp; Catalogues to
be had at the sale.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Admiral Sir John Balchen resided at Little Chelsea soon after
Sir James Wishart&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; In 1744, Admiral Balchen
perished in the Victory, of 120 guns, which had the reputation of
being the most beautiful ship in the world, but foundered, with
eleven hundred souls on board, in the Bay of Biscay.</p>
<p>On the 31st of March, 1723, Edward Hyde, the third Earl of
Clarendon, died &ldquo;at his house, Little Chelsea;&rdquo; but
where the earl&rsquo;s house stood I am unable to state.</p>
<p>Mrs. Robinson, the fascinating &ldquo;Perdita,&rdquo; tells
us, in her <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>autobiography, that, at the age of
ten (1768), she was &ldquo;placed for education in a school at
Chelsea.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she then commences a most distressing
narrative, in which the last tragic scene she was witness to
occurred at Little Chelsea.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mistress of this seminary,&rdquo; Mrs.
Robinson describes as &ldquo;perhaps one of the most
extraordinary women that ever graced, or disgraced,
society.&nbsp; Her name was Meribah Lorrington.&nbsp; She was the
most extensively accomplished female that I ever remember to have
met with; her mental powers were no less capable of cultivation
than superiorly cultivated.&nbsp; Her father, whose name was
Hull, had from her infancy been master of an academy at
Earl&rsquo;s Court, near Fulham; and early after his marriage,
losing his wife, he resolved on giving this daughter a masculine
education.&nbsp; Meribah was early instructed in all the modern
accomplishments, as well as in classical knowledge.&nbsp; She was
mistress of the Latin, French, and Italian languages; she was
said to be a perfect arithmetician and astronomer, and possessed
the art of painting on silk to a degree of exquisite
perfection.&nbsp; But, alas! with all these advantages, she was
addicted to one vice, which at times so completely absorbed her
faculties as to deprive her of every power, either mental or
corporeal.&nbsp; Thus, daily and hourly, her superior
acquirements, her enlightened understanding, yielded to the
intemperance of her ruling infatuation, and every power of
reflection seemed absorbed in the unfeminine propensity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that I ever learned,&rdquo; adds Mrs. Robinson,
&ldquo;I acquired from this extraordinary woman.&nbsp; In those
hours when her senses were not intoxicated, she would delight in
the task of instructing me.&nbsp; She had only five or six
pupils, and it was my lot to be her particular favourite.&nbsp;
She always, out of school, called me her little friend, and made
no scruple of conversing with me (sometimes half the night, for I
slept in her chamber) on domestic and confidential affairs.&nbsp;
I felt for her very sincere affection, and I listened with
peculiar attention to all the lessons she inculcated.&nbsp; Once
I recollect her mentioning the particular failing which disgraced
so intelligent a being.&nbsp; She pleaded, in excuse of it, the
unmitigable regret of a widowed heart, and with compunction
declared that she flew to intoxication as the only refuge from
the pang of prevailing sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Mrs. Robinson remained more than twelve months under
the care of Mrs. Lorrington,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When pecuniary derangements obliged her to
give up her school.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s manners were
singularly disgusting, as was his appearance, for he wore a
silvery beard, which reached to his breast, and a kind of Persian
robe, which gave him the external appearance of a
necromancer.&nbsp; He was of the Anabaptist persuasion, and so
stern in his conversation, that the young pupils were exposed to
perpetual terror; added to these circumstances, the failing of
his daughter became so evident, that even during school-hours she
was frequently in a state of confirmed intoxication.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1772, three years afterwards, when Mrs. Robinson was
fourteen, her mother, Mrs. Darby, was obliged, as a means of
support, to undertake the task of tuition.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For this purpose, a convenient house was
hired at Little Chelsea, and furnished for a ladies&rsquo;
boarding-school.&nbsp; Assistants of every kind were engaged, and
I,&rdquo; says Mrs. Robinson, &ldquo;was deemed worthy of an
occupation that flattered my self-love, and impressed my mind
with a sort of domestic consequence.&nbsp; The English language
was my department in the seminary, and I was permitted to select
passages both in prose and verse for the studies of my infant
pupils; it was also my occupation to superintend their wardrobes,
to see them dressed and undressed by the servants, or
half-boarders, and to read sacred and moral lessons on
saints&rsquo; days and Sunday evenings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly after my mother had established herself at
Chelsea, on a summer&rsquo;s evening, as I was sitting at the
window, I heard a deep sigh, or rather groan of anguish, which
suddenly attracted my attention.&nbsp; The night was approaching
rapidly, and I looked towards the gate before the house, where I
observed a woman, evidently labouring under excessive
affliction.&nbsp; I instantly descended and approached her.&nbsp;
She, bursting into tears, asked whether I did not know her.&nbsp;
Her dress was torn and filthy; she was almost naked, and an old
bonnet, which nearly hid her face, so completely disfigured her
features, that I had not the smallest idea of the person who was
then almost sinking before me.&nbsp; I gave her a small sum of
money, and inquired the cause of her apparent agony.&nbsp; She
took my hand, and pressed it to her lips.&nbsp; <!-- page
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&lsquo;Sweet girl,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you are
still the angel I ever knew you!&rsquo;&nbsp; I was
astonished.&nbsp; She raised her bonnet; her fine dark eyes met
mine.&nbsp; It was Mrs. Lorrington.&nbsp; I led her into the
house; my mother was not at home.&nbsp; I took her to my chamber,
and, with the assistance of a lady, who was our French teacher, I
clothed and comforted her.&nbsp; She refused to say how she came
to be in so deplorable a situation, and took her leave.&nbsp; It
was in vain that I entreated&mdash;that I conjured her to let me
know where I might send to her.&nbsp; She refused to give me her
address, but promised that in a few days she would call on me
again.&nbsp; It is impossible to describe the wretched appearance
of this accomplished woman.&nbsp; The failing to which she had
now yielded, as to a monster that would destroy her, was evident,
even at the moment when she was speaking to me.&nbsp; I saw no
more of her; but, to my infinite regret, I was informed, some
years after, that she had died, the martyr of a premature decay,
brought on by the indulgence of her propensity to
intoxication&mdash;in the workhouse of Chelsea!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Robinson adds, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The number of my mother&rsquo;s pupils in a
few months amounted to ten or twelve; and, just at a period when
an honourable independence promised to cheer the days of an
unexampled parent, my father unexpectedly returned from
America.&nbsp; The pride of his soul was deeply wounded by the
step which my mother had taken; he was offended even beyond the
bounds of reason.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the expiration of eight months, my mother, by my
father&rsquo;s positive commands, broke up her establishment, and
returned to London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly opposite to the workhouse is the West Brompton Brewery,
formerly called &ldquo;Holly Wood Brewery,&rdquo; and immediately
beyond it an irregular row of six houses, which stand a little
way back from the road, with small gardens before them.&nbsp; The
first house is now divided into two, occupied, when the sketch
was made in 1844, by Miss Read&rsquo;s academy (Tavistock House)
and Mrs. Corder&rsquo;s Preparatory School; the latter (Bolton
House) to be <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>distinguished by two ornamented
stone-balls on the piers of the gateway, was a celebrated
military academy, at which many distinguished soldiers have been
educated.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p119.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=

</a>The academy was established about the year 1770, by Mr. Lewis
Lochee, who died on the 5th of April, 1787, and who, in 1778,
published an &lsquo;Essay on Castrametation.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The premises,&rdquo; says Mr. Faulkner, &ldquo;which were
laid out as a regular fortification, and were open to view,
excited much attention at the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; When balloons
were novelties, and it was supposed might be advantageously used
in the operations of warfare, they attracted considerable notice;
and, on the 16th of October, 1784, Mr. Blanchard ascended from
the grounds of the Military Academy, near Chelsea.&nbsp; The
anxiety to witness this exhibition is thus described in a
contemporary account:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fields for a considerable way round
Little Chelsea were crowded with horse and foot; in consequence
of which a general devastation took place in the gardens, the
produce being either trampled down or torn up.&nbsp; The turnip
grounds were totally despoiled by the multitude.&nbsp; All the
windows and houses round the academy were filled with people of
the first fashion.&nbsp; Every roof within view was covered, and
each tree filled with spectators.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Blanchard, upon this occasion, ascended with some
difficulty, accompanied by a Mr. Sheldon, a surgeon, whom <!--
page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>he landed at Sunbury, from whence Blanchard proceeded
in his balloon to Romsey, in Hampshire, where he came down in
safety, after having been between three and four hours in the
air.</p>
<p>After Mr. Lochee&rsquo;s death, his son, Mr. Lewis Lochee,
continued the establishment which his father had formed, but,
unfortunately for himself, engaged in the revolutionary movements
which agitated Flanders in 1790; where, &ldquo;being taken
prisoner by the Austrians, he was condemned to be hanged.&nbsp;
He, however, obtained permission to come to England to settle his
affairs, upon condition of leaving his only son as a hostage;
and, upon his return to the Continent, he suffered the punishment
of death.&rdquo; <a name="citation120"></a><a href="#footnote120"
class="citation">[120]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;His son, a schoolfellow of mine,&rdquo; adds Mr.
Faulkner, &ldquo;afterwards married a daughter of the late Mr.
King, an eminent book auctioneer of King Street, Covent Garden,
and, lamentable to relate, fell by his own hands,&rdquo; 8th of
December, 1815.</p>
<p>The residence beyond Mr. Lochee&rsquo;s Military Academy is
named <span class="smcap">Warwick House</span>&mdash;why, unless,
possibly, the name has some reference to Boyle&rsquo;s
brother-in-law, the Earl of Warwick, I am at a loss to
determine.&nbsp; The next house is Amyot House.&nbsp; Then comes
<span class="smcap">Mulberry House</span>, formerly the residence
of Mr. Denham, a brother of the lamented African traveller,
Colonel Denham.&nbsp; The fifth house is called <span
class="smcap">Heckfield Lodge</span>, an arbitrary name <!-- page
121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>bestowed by its late occupant, Mr. Milton, the author
of two clever novels, &lsquo;Rivalry,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lady
Cecilia Farrencourt,&rsquo; recently published, and brother to
the popular authoress, Mrs. Trollope.&nbsp; And the sixth and
last house in the row, on the west side of which is Walnut-tree
Walk, leading to Earl&rsquo;s Court and Kensington, is
distinguished by the name of Burleigh House, which, some one
humorously observed, <a name="citation121"></a><a
href="#footnote121" class="citation">[121]</a> might possibly be
a contraction of &ldquo;hurley burley,&rdquo; the house being a
ladies&rsquo; school, and the unceasing work of education, on the
main Fulham Road, appearing here for the first time to
terminate.&nbsp;

</a>The following entry, however, in the parish register of
Kensington, respecting the birth of the fourth Earl of Exeter, on
the 21st of May, 1674, may suggest a more probable
derivation:&mdash;&ldquo;15 May.&nbsp; Honble. John Cecill, son
and heir apparent of the Rt. Honble. John Lord Burleigh and the
Lady Anne his wife born at Mr. Sheffield&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Boscawen, the amiable and accomplished translator of
Horace, resided at Burleigh House; and here he died, on the 6th
of May, 1811, at the age of fifty-nine.&nbsp; He had been called
to the bar, but gave up that profession in 1786, on being
appointed a commissioner for victualling <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>the
navy.&nbsp; An excellent classical scholar, and warmly attached
to literary pursuits, Mr. Boscawen published, in 1793, the first
volume of a new translation of Horace, containing the
&lsquo;Odes,&rsquo; &lsquo;Epodes,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Carmen
S&aelig;culare.&rsquo;&nbsp; This, being well received, was
followed up by Mr. Boscawen, in 1798, by his translation of the
&lsquo;Satires, Epistles, and Art of
Poetry,&rsquo;&mdash;completing a work considered to be in many
respects superior to Francis&rsquo;s translation.&nbsp; As an
early patron and zealous friend of the Literary Fund, Mr.
Boscawen&rsquo;s memory will be regarded with respect.&nbsp;
Within five days of his death, he wrote a copy of verses for the
anniversary meeting, which he contemplated attending:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Relieved from toils, behold the aged
steed<br />
Contented crop the rich enamell&rsquo;d mead,<br />
Bask in the solar ray, or court the shade,<br />
As vernal suns invite, or summer heats invade!<br />
But should the horn or clarion from afar<br />
Call to the chase, or summon to the war,<br />
Roused to new vigour by the well-known sound,<br />
He spurns the earth, o&rsquo;erleaps the opposing mound,<br />
Feels youthful ardour in each swelling vein,<br />
Darts through the rapid flood, and scours the plain!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Thus a lorn Muse, who, worn by cares and
woes,<br />
Long sought retirement&rsquo;s calm, secure repose,<br />
With glad, though feeble, voice resumes her lay,<br />
Waked by the call of this auspicious day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas! the hand which on May morning had penned this
introduction to an appeal in the cause of literary
benevolence,&mdash;that hand was cold; and the lips by which, on
the following day, the words that had flowed warmly from the <!--
page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>heart were to have been uttered,&mdash;those lips were
mute in death within a week.</p>
<p>On the 16th of April, 1765, Mr. James House Knight, of Walham
Green, returning home from London, was robbed and murdered on the
highroad in the vicinity of Little Chelsea; the record of his
burial in the parish register of Kensington is, &ldquo;Shot in
Fulham Road, near Brompton.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the discovery of the
murderers a reward of fifty pounds was offered; and, on the 7th
of July following, two Chelsea pensioners were committed to
prison, charged with this murder, on the testimony of their
accomplice, another Chelsea pensioner, whom they had threatened
to kill upon some quarrel taking place between them.&nbsp; The
accused were tried, found guilty, hanged, and gibbeted; one
nearly opposite Walnut-tree Walk, close by the two-mile stone,
the other at Bull Lane, a passage about a quarter of a mile
farther on, which connects the main Fulham Road with the
King&rsquo;s Road, by the side of the Kensington Canal.&nbsp; In
these positions, for some years, the bodies of the murderers hung
in chains, to the terror of benighted travellers and of
market-gardeners, who</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Wended their way,<br />
In morning&rsquo;s grey,&rdquo;</p>
<p>towards Covent Garden, until a drunken frolic caused the
removal of a painful and useless exhibition.&nbsp; A very
interesting paper upon London life in the last century occurs in
the second volume of Knight&rsquo;s &lsquo;London;&rsquo; in
which it is observed that &ldquo;a gibbet&rsquo;s tassel&rdquo;
was one of the first sights which met the eye of a stranger
approaching London from the sea.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>&ldquo;About the middle of the last
century, similar objects met the gaze of the traveller by
whatever route he entered the metropolis.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>All</i>
the gibbets in the Edgware Road,&rsquo; says an extract from the
newspapers of the day in the &lsquo;Annual Register&rsquo; for
1763, &lsquo;on which <i>many</i> malefactors were being hung in
chains, were cut down by persons unknown.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
<i>all</i> and the <i>many</i> of this cool matter-of-fact
announcement conjure up the image of a long avenue planted with
&lsquo;gallows-trees,&rsquo; instead of elms and
poplars,&mdash;an assemblage of pendent criminals, not exactly
&lsquo;thick as leaves that strew the brook in Valombrosa,&rsquo;
but frequent as those whose feet tickling Sancho&rsquo;s nose,
when he essayed to sleep in the cork forest, drove him from tree
to tree in search of an empty bough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frequent mention is made in the books, magazines, and
newspapers of that period, of the bodies of malefactors conveyed
after execution to Blackheath, Finchley, and Kennington Commons,
or Hounslow Heath, for the purpose of being there permanently
suspended.&nbsp; In those days the approach to London on all
sides seems to have lain through serried files of gibbets,
growing closer and more thronged as the distance from the city
diminished, till they and their occupants arranged themselves in
rows of ghastly and grinning sentinels along both sides of the
principal avenues.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This picture is not over-coloured; and it is to the following
occurrence in the main Fulham Road that the removal of these
offensive exhibitions is to be attributed.&nbsp; Two or three
fashionable parsons, who had sacrificed superabundantly to the
jolly god at Fulham, returning to London, where they desired to
arrive quickly, had intellect enough to discover that the driver
of their post-chaise did not make his horses proceed at a pace
equal to their wishes, and, after in vain urging him to more
speed, one of them declared that, if he did not use his whip with
better effect, he should be made an example of for the public
benefit, and hanged up at the first gibbet.&nbsp; The correctness
of the old saying, that &ldquo;when the head is hot the <!-- page
125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>hand is ready,&rdquo; was soon verified by the postboy
being desired to stop at the gibbet opposite Walnut-tree Walk,
which order, unluckily for himself, he obeyed, instead of
proceeding at a quicker pace.&nbsp; Out sprung the inmates of his
chaise; they seized him, bound him hand and foot, and throwing a
rope, which they had fastened round his body, over the gibbet, he
soon found himself, in spite of his cries and entreaties,
elevated in air beside the tarred remains of the Chelsea
pensioner.</p>
<p>The reverend perpetrators of the deed drove off, leaving the
luckless postboy to protest, loudly and vainly, to &ldquo;the
dull, cold ear of death,&rdquo; against the loathsome
companionship.&nbsp; When the first market-gardener&rsquo;s cart
passed by, most lustily did he call for help; but every effort to
get free only tended to prolong his suspense.&nbsp; What could
the carters and other early travellers imagine upon hearing
shouts proceeding from the gibbet, but that the identical
murderer of Mr. Knight had by some miracle come to life, and now
called out, &ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; with the intention of
robbing and murdering them also?&nbsp; And they, feeling that
supernatural odds were against them, ran forwards or backwards,
not daring to look behind, as fast as their feet could carry
alarmed and bewildered heads, leaving the fate of their carts to
the sagacity of the horses.&nbsp; Finding that the louder he
called for help the more alarm he excited, the suspended postboy
determined philosophically to endure the misery of his situation
in dignified silence.&nbsp; But there he was suffered to hang
unnoticed; or, if remarked, it was only concluded that another
criminal had been added to the gibbet, as its second
tassel.&nbsp; The <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>circumstance, however, of a second
body having been placed there speedily came to the knowledge of a
magistrate in the neighbourhood, who had taken an active part in
the apprehension of Mr. Knight&rsquo;s murderers; and he
proceeded, without delay, to the spot, that he might satisfy
himself as to the correctness of the report.&nbsp; Judge,
however, his astonishment on hearing himself addressed by name
from the gibbet, and implored, in the most piteous manner, to
deliver from bondage a poor postboy, whose only offence was that
he would not goad on two overworked horses to humour a pair of
drunken gentlemen.&nbsp; These &ldquo;drunken gentlemen&rdquo;
are said to have been men of rank and influence: their names have
never transpired, but the outrage with which they were charged
led to the immediate removal from the Fulham Road of the last
pair of gibbets which disgraced it.</p>
<p>Upon the ground which was occupied by the gibbet where the
kind-hearted postboy was strung up, a solitary cottage stood some
years ago; and tradition asserted, that both the murderer and his
gibbet were buried beneath it.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p126.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=
"Solitary cottage"
title=
"Solitary cottage"
src="images/p126.jpg" />
</a>This cottage is now pulled down; Lansdowne Villas and
Hollywood Place have been erected on the spot, and villas and
groves continue to the &lsquo;Gunter Arms,&rsquo; a public-house
that <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>takes its name from Richard Gunter,
the well-known confectioner, by the side of which is Gunter
Grove.&nbsp; This is now the starting-point of the Brompton
omnibuses, which formerly did not go beyond Queen&rsquo;s
Elm.&nbsp; Edith Grove, a turning between Lansdowne Villas and
Gunter Grove, is in a direct line with Cremorne Gardens.</p>
<p>Proceeding on our road towards Fulham, the next point which
claims attention is the extensive inclosure of the West of London
and Westminster Cemetery Company,&mdash;a company incorporated by
act of parliament 1st of Victoria, cap. 180.&nbsp; The
burial-ground was consecrated on the 12th of June, 1840, and
extends from the Fulham Road to what is called, generally,
&ldquo;Sir John Scott Lillie&rsquo;s Road,&rdquo; and sometimes
&ldquo;Brompton Lane Road,&rdquo; which, in fact, is a
continuation, to North End, Fulham, of the line of the Old
Brompton Road,&mdash;the point, as the reader may recollect, that
we turned off from at the Bell and Horns, in order to follow the
main Fulham Road to Little Chelsea.&nbsp; The public way on the
east of the burial-ground is called Honey Lane, and on the west
the boundary is the pathway by the side of the Kensington
Canal.&nbsp; The architect of the chapel and catacombs is Mr.
Benjamin Baud.&nbsp; The cemetery is open for public inspection,
free of charge, from seven in the morning till sunset, except on
Sundays, when it is closed till half-past one
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The first interment took place on the 18th
of June, 1840, from which time, to the 22nd of November, there
were thirty-four burials, the average number being then four per
week.&nbsp; It is scarcely necessary to add, that a considerable
average increase has taken place; but the first step in
statistics is always curious.</p>
<p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>One of the most interesting instances of longevity
which the annals of the West of London and Westminster Cemetery
Company present occurs on a stone in the north-east corner of the
burial-ground, where the age recorded of Louis Pouch&eacute;e is
108; but this does not agree with the burial entry made by the
Rev. Stephen Reid Cattley&mdash;&ldquo;Louis Pouch&eacute;e, of
St. Martin&rsquo;s in the Fields, viz., 40 Castle Street,
Leicester Square, buried Feb. 21, 1843, aged 107.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This musical patriarch, however, according to a statement in
the &lsquo;Medical Times,&rsquo; <a name="citation128"></a><a
href="#footnote128" class="citation">[128]</a> was admitted as a
patient to St. George&rsquo;s Hospital November 24, 1842.&nbsp;
January 4, went out, and died, about three months afterwards, of
diarrhoea and dysentery.</p>
<p>Another instance of longevity, though not so extraordinary, is
one which cannot be contemplated without feeling how much
influence the consciousness of honest industry in the human mind
has upon the health and happiness of the body.&nbsp; A gravestone
near a public path on the south-east side of the burial-ground
marks the last resting place of Francis Nicholson,
landscape-painter, who died the 6th March, 1844, aged 91
years.</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholson originally practised as a portrait-painter, but
the simplicity and uprightness of his heart did not permit him to
tolerate or pander to the vanities of man (and woman) kind.&nbsp;
To flatter was with him an utter impossibility; and, as he could
not invariably consider the &ldquo;human face divine,&rdquo; he
was incapable of assuming the courtly manners so essential in
that branch of the <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>profession.&nbsp; He never, indeed,
quite forgave himself for an approach to duplicity committed at
this time upon an unfortunate gentleman, who sat to him for his
portrait, and who squinted so desperately, that in order to gain
a likeness it was necessary to copy moderately the defect.&nbsp;
The poor man, it seemed, perfectly unconscious of the same, on
being invited to inspect the performance, looked in silence upon
it a few moments, and, with rather a disappointed air,
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it seems to me&mdash;does it
squint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squint!&rdquo; replied Nicholson, &ldquo;no more than
you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! well, you know best of course; but I declare I
fancied there was a <i>queer look</i> about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opening of the Water-Colour Exhibition, in 1805, may be
dated as the commencement of Mr. Nicholson&rsquo;s fame and
success in London.&nbsp; In conjunction with Glover, Varley,
Prout, and others, an advance in the art of watercolour painting
was made, such as to astonish and call forth the admiration of
the public.</p>
<p>In a manuscript autobiography which Mr. Nicholson left behind
him, and which is full of curious anecdotes, he gives the
following account of the formation of that exhibition.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Messrs. Hills and Pyne asked me to join in
the attempt to establish such a society, which I readily agreed
to.&nbsp; It was a long time before a number of members
sufficient to produce so many works as would be required to cover
the walls of the exhibition room in Brook Street could be brought
to join it.&nbsp; Artists were afraid they might suffer loss by
renting and fitting up the room, the expense being certain and
the success very doubtful.&nbsp; After a great while the society
was formed, and, in the first and second exhibition, the sale of
drawings was so <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>considerable, and the visitors so
numerous, that crowds of those who had refused to join were eager
to be admitted into the society.&rdquo;</p>

131</span>Stanley House, or Stanley Grove House, which was
purchased in 1840 for upwards of &pound;9000 by the society,
stood upon the site of a house which Sir Arthur Gorges, the
friend of Spenser, allegorically named by him Alcyon, <a
name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131"
class="citation">[131]</a> built for his own residence; and upon
the death of whose first wife, a daughter of Viscount Bindon, in
1590, the poet wrote a beautiful elegy, entitled
&lsquo;Daphnaida.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the Sydney papers mention is
made, under date 15th November, 1599, that, &ldquo;as the queen
passed by the faire new building, Sir Arthur Gorges presented her
with a faire jewell.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died in 1625; and by his
widow, the daughter of the Earl of Lincoln, the house and
adjacent land, then called the &ldquo;Brickhills,&rdquo; was
sold, in 1637, to their only daughter, Elizabeth, the widow of
Sir Robert Stanley; which sale was confirmed by her
mother&rsquo;s will, dated 18th July, 1643.&nbsp; The Stanley
family continued to reside here until 1691, when by the death of
William Stanley, Esq., that branch of this family became extinct
in the male line.</p>
<p>The present house, a square mansion, was built soon
afterwards; and the old wall, propped by several buttresses,
inclosing the west side of the grounds, existed on the bank of
the Kensington Canal until it was washed down by a very high
tide.&nbsp; This new or square mansion remained unfinished and
unoccupied for several years.&nbsp; In 1724 it belonged to Henry
Arundel, Esq. and on the 24th May, 1743, Admiral Sir Charles
Wager, a distinguished naval officer, died here, and was buried
in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; After passing through several hands,
<!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>Stanley Grove became the property of Miss Southwell,
afterwards the wife of Sir James Eyre, Lord Chief Justice of the
Common Pleas, who sold it in 1777 to the Countess of
Strathmore.</p>
<p>Here her ladyship indulged her love for botany by building
extensive hot-houses and conservatories, and collecting and
introducing into England rare exotics.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She had purchased,&rdquo; says her
biographer, &ldquo;a fine old mansion, with extensive grounds
well walled in, and there she had brought exotics from the Cape,
and was in a way of raising continually an increase to her
collection, when, by her fatal marriage, the cruel spoiler came
and threw them, like loathsome weeds, away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Lochee, before mentioned, purchased Stanley Grove from the
Countess of Strathmore and her husband, Mr. Bowes.&nbsp; It was
afterwards occupied by Dr. Richard Warren, the eminent physician,
who died in 1797, and who is said to have acquired by the
honourable practice of his profession no less a sum than
&pound;150,000.&nbsp; In January 1808, Mr. Leonard Morse, of the
War Office, died at his residence, Stanley House, and about 1815
it was purchased by the late Mr. William Richard Hamilton, who
ranks as one of the first scholars and antiquaries of his
day.&nbsp; Between that year and 1840 Mr. Hamilton resided here
at various periods, having occasionally let it.&nbsp; He made a
considerable addition to the house by building a spacious room as
a wing on the east side, in the walls of which casts from the
frieze and metopes of the Elgin marbles were let in.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hamilton proceeded as envoy to the court of Naples in
1821, Stanley Grove House became the residence <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>of Mrs.
Gregor, and is thus described by Miss Burney, who was an inmate
at this time, in the following playful letter <a
name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133"
class="citation">[133]</a> to a friend, dated 24th September,
1821:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whilst you have been traversing sea and
land, scrambling up rocks and shuddering beside precipices, I
have been stationary, with no other variety than such as turning
to the right instead of the left when walking in the garden, or
sometimes driving into town through Westminster, and, at other
times, through Piccadilly.&nbsp; Poor Miss Gregor continues to be
a complete invalid, and, for her sake, we give up all society at
home and all engagements abroad.&nbsp; Luckily, the house, rented
by Mrs. Gregor from William Hamilton, Esq. (who accompanied Lord
Elgin into Greece) abounds with interesting specimens in almost
every branch of the fine arts.&nbsp; Here are statues, casts from
the frieze of the Parthenon, pictures, prints, books, and
minerals; <i>four</i> pianofortes of different sizes, and an
excellent harp.&nbsp; All this to study does Desdemona
(that&rsquo;s me) seriously incline; and the more I study the
more I want to know and to see.&nbsp; In short, I am crazy to
travel in Greece!&nbsp; The danger is that some good-for-nothing
bashaw should seize upon me to poke me into his harem, there to
bury my charms for life, and condemn me for ever to blush
unseen.&nbsp; However, I could easily strangle or stab him, set
fire to his castle, and run away by the light of it, accompanied
by some handsome pirate, with whom I might henceforward live at
my ease in a cavern on the sea-shore, dressing his dinners one
moment, and my own sweet person the next in pearls and rubies,
stolen by him, during some of his plundering expeditions, from
the fair throat and arms of a shrieking Circassian beauty, whose
lord he had knocked on the head.&nbsp; Till these genteel
adventures of mine begin, I beg you to believe me, dear Miss

Kempe died here on 21st August, 1846.&nbsp; The three last houses
of the Stamford Villas are not &ldquo;wedded to each

Hampton, who made an ascent in a balloon from Cremorne, on the
13th June, 1839, with every reasonable prospect of breaking his
neck for the amusement of the public, came down by a parachute
descent, without injury to himself, although he carried away a
brick or two from the chimney of the house, much to the annoyance
of the person in charge, who rushed out upon the aeronaut, and
told him that he had no business to come in contact with the
chimney.&nbsp; His reply exhibited an extraordinary coolness, for
he assured the man it was quite unintentional upon his part.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">walham green to

<p>The village of Walham Green, which is distant from Hyde Park
Corner between two and a half and three miles, appears to have
been first so called soon after the revolution of 1688.&nbsp;
Before this, it was known as Wansdon Green, written also Wandon
and Wandham; all of which names, according to Lysons, originated
from the manor of Wendon, so was the local name written in 1449,
which in 1565 was spelled Wandowne.&nbsp; As the name of a low
and marshy piece of land on the opposite side of the Thames to
Wandsworth, through which <i>wandered</i> the drainage from the
higher grounds, or through which the traveller had to
<i>Wendon</i> (pendan) his way to Fulham; it would not be
difficult to enter into speculations as to the Anglo-Saxon origin
of the word, but I refrain from placing before the reader my
antiquarian ruminations while passing Wansdown House, for few
things are more fascinating and deceptive than verbal
associations.&nbsp; Indeed, if indulged in to any extent, they
might lead an enthusiast to connect in thought the piers of
Fulham (bridge) with the <i>Piers</i> of <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>Fulham,
who, in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, &ldquo;compyled many
praty conceytis in love under covert terms of ffyssyng and
ffowlyng;&rdquo; and which curious poem may be found printed in a
collection of <i>Ancient Metrical Tales</i>, edited by the Rev.
Charles Henry Hartshorne. <a name="citation138"></a><a
href="#footnote138" class="citation">[138]</a></p>
<p>Two of &ldquo;some ancient houses, erected in 1595, as
appeared by a date on the truss in the front of one of
them,&rdquo; were pulled down at Walham Green in 1812; after
which the important proceedings in the progress of this village
in suburban advancement consisted in the establishment of
numerous public-houses; the filling up of a filthy pond, upon the
ground gained by which act a chapel-of-ease to Fulham, dedicated
to St. John, has been built, after the design of Mr. Taylor, at
the estimated expense of &pound;9683 17s. 9d.&nbsp; The first
stone was laid on the 1st of January, 1827; and it was
consecrated by the Bishop of London on the 14th of August,
1828.&nbsp; This was followed by the building of a charity-school
upon an angular patch of green, or common land, where donkeys had
been wont to graze, and the village children to play at
cricket.&nbsp; Then the parish pound was removed from a corner of
the high road, near a basket-maker&rsquo;s, to a back lane,
thereby destroying the travelling joke of &ldquo;Did you ever see
the baskets sold by the pound?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, finally, Walham
Green has assumed a new aspect, from the construction of the
Butchers&rsquo; Almshouses, the first stone of which was laid by
the late Lord Ravensworth, on the 1st of July, 1840.&nbsp; Since
that time, fancy-fairs and bazaars, with horticultural
exhibitions, have been fashionably patronised at Walham <!-- page
139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Green by omnibus companies, for the support and
enlargement of this institution.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Hail, happy isle! and happier Walham
Green!<br />
Where all that&rsquo;s fair and beautiful are seen!<br />
Where wanton zephyrs court the ambient air,<br />
And sweets ambrosial banish every care;<br />
Where thought nor trouble social joy molest,<br />
Nor vain solicitude can banish rest.<br />
Peaceful and happy here I reign serene,<br />
Perplexity defy, and smile at spleen;<br />
Belles, beaux, and statesmen, all around me shine;<br />
All own me their supreme, me constitute divine;<br />
All wait my pleasure, own my awful nod,<br />
And change the humble gardener to the god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, in the &lsquo;London Magazine&rsquo; for June 1749, did
Mr. Bartholomew Rocque prophetically apostrophise Walham
Green,&mdash;the &ldquo;belles, beaux, and statesmen,&rdquo; by
which he was surrounded being new varieties of flowers, dignified
by distinguished names.&nbsp; In 1755, he printed a
&lsquo;Treatise on the Cultivation of the Hyacinth, translated
from the Dutch;&rsquo; and in 1761 an &lsquo;Essay on Lucerne
Grass,&rsquo;, of which an enlarged edition was published in
1764.&nbsp; Mr. Rocque <a name="citation139"></a><a
href="#footnote139" class="citation">[139]</a> resided in the
house occupied by the late Mr. King, opposite to the Red Lion,
where Mr. Oliver Pitts now carries on business as builder and
carpenter.</p>
<p>Immediately after leaving Walham Green, on the south, or
left-hand side, of the main Fulham road, behind a pair of
carriage gates, connected by a brick wall, stands the <!-- page
140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>mansion of Lord Ravensworth; in outward appearance
small and unostentatious, without the slightest attempt at
architectural decoration, but sufficiently spacious and
attractive to have received the highest honour that can be
conferred on the residence of a subject, by her Majesty and
Prince Albert having visited the late lord here on the 26th of
June, 1840.&nbsp; The grounds at the back of the house, though
not extensive, were planted with peculiar skill, care, and taste,
by the late Mr. Ord; and on that occasion recalled to memory the
words of our old poet, the author of &lsquo;Britannia&rsquo;s
Pastorals,&rsquo; William Browne:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;There stood the elme, whose shade so
mildely dym<br />
Doth nourish all that groweth under him:<br />
Cipresse that like piramides runne topping,<br />
And hurt the least of any by the dropping;<br />
The alder, whose fat shadow nourisheth<br />
Each plant set neere to him long flourisheth;<br />
The heavie-headed plane-tree, by whose shade<br />
The grasse grows thickest, men are fresher made;<br />
The oak that best endures the thunder-shocks,<br />
The everlasting, ebene, cedar, boxe.<br />
The olive, that in wainscot never cleaves,<br />
The amourous vine which in the elme still weaves;<br />
The lotus, juniper, where wormes ne&rsquo;er enter;<br />
The pyne, with whom men through the ocean venture;<br />
The warlike yewgh, by which (more than the lance)<br />
The strong-arm&rsquo;d English spirits conquer&rsquo;d France;<br
/>
Amongst the rest, the tamarisks there stood,<br />
For housewives&rsquo; besomes only knowne most good;<br />
The cold-place-loving birch, and servis-tree;<br />
The Walnut-loving vales and mulberry;<br />
The maple, ashe, that doe delight in fountains,<br />
Which have their currents by the side of mountains;<br />
The laurell, mirtle, ivy, date, which hold<br />
Their leaves all winter, be it ne&rsquo;er so cold;<br />
<!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

The beech, that scales the welkin with his top:<br />
<i>All these and thousand more within this grove</i>,<br />
<i>By all the industry of nature strove</i><br />
<i>To frame an arbour that might keepe within it</i><br />
<i>The best of beauties that the world hath in it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the royal visit, Lord Ravensworth&rsquo;s residence has
been called <i>Percy Cross</i>, but no reason has been assigned
for the alteration of name from Purser&rsquo;s Cross, which is
mentioned as a point &ldquo;on the Fulham road between
Parson&rsquo;s Green and Walham Green,&rdquo; so far back as
1602, and at which we shall presently arrive.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p141.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=

"View of Percy Cross"
src="images/p141.jpg" />
</a>No connection whatever that I am aware of exists between the
locality and the Percy family, and it only affords another, very
recent local example of what has been as happily as quaintly
termed &ldquo;the curiosity of change.&rdquo;&nbsp; The most
favourable aspect of the house is, perhaps, the view gained of it
from a neighbouring garden across a piece of water called Eel
Brook, which ornaments an adjacent meadow.</p>
<p>John Ord, Esq., the creator of Lord Ravensworth&rsquo;s London
residence, is better known as &ldquo;Master Ord.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was the only son of Robert Ord, Chief Baron of the Court of
Exchequer in Scotland.&nbsp; In 1746 Mr. Ord entered Trinity
College, Cambridge, and in 1762, vacated a lay fellowship <!--
page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>by marriage with Eleanor, the second daughter of John
Simpson, Esq., of Bradley, in the county of Durham.&nbsp; After
being called to the bar, Mr. Ord practised in the Court of
Chancery; and, in 1774, was returned to parliament as member for
Midhurst.&nbsp; In 1778 he was appointed Master of Chancery; and
the next session, when returned member for Hastings, was chosen
chairman of &ldquo;Ways and Means,&rdquo; in which situation his
conduct gave much satisfaction.&nbsp; Mr. Ord retired from
parliament in 1790, and in 1809 resigned his office of Master in
Chancery, and that of Attorney-General for Lancaster the
following year, when &ldquo;he retired to a small place at
Purser&rsquo;s Cross, in the parish of Fulham, where he had early
in life amused himself in horticultural pursuits, and where there
are several foreign trees of his own raising remarkable both for
their beauty and size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lysons, in 1795, says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While I am speaking upon this
subject&rdquo; (the trees planted by Bishop Compton in the
gardens of Fulham Palace), &ldquo;it would he unpardonable to
omit the mention of a very curious garden near Walham Green in
this parish, planted, since the year 1756, by its present
proprietor, John Ord, Esq., Master in Chancery.&nbsp; It is not a
little extraordinary that this garden should, within the space of
forty years (such have been the effects of good management and a
fertile soil), have produced trees which are now the finest of
their respective kinds in the kingdom.&nbsp; As a proof of this
may be mentioned the <i>sophora Japonica</i>, planted anno 1756,
then about two feet high, now eight feet in girth, and about
forty in height; a standard <i>Ginko</i> tree, planted about the
year 1767, two feet three inches in girth; and an Illinois
walnut, two feet two inches in girth, growing where it was sown
about the year 1760.&nbsp; Among other trees, very remarkable
also for their growth, though not to be spoken of as the largest
of their kind, are a black walnut-tree (sown anno 1757), about
forty feet high, and five feet four inches in girth; a cedar of
Libanus (planted in <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>1756), eight feet eight inches in
girth; a willow-leaved oak (sown anno 1757), four feet in girth;
the Rhus Vernix, or varnish sumach, four feet in girth; and a
stone pine of very singular growth.&nbsp; Its girth at one foot
from the ground is six feet four inches; at that height it
immediately begins to branch out, and spreads, at least,
twenty-one feet on each side, forming a large bush of about
fourteen yards in diameter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second edition of Lysons&rsquo; &lsquo;Environs of
London&rsquo; appeared in 1810, when the measurement of these
trees, in June 1808 and December 1809, was placed in
apposition.&nbsp; Faulkner&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of
Fulham,&rsquo; published in 1813, carries on the history of their
growth for three years more; but as, from the marginal pencil
note signed J. M., and dated January 1835 in Lysons&rsquo;, I am
led to conclude that some of these interesting trees exist no
longer, the following tabular view compiled from these sources
may not be unacceptable to the naturalist, who is well aware
that</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Not small the praise the skilful planter
claims,<br />
From his befriended country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About the time of Mr. Ord&rsquo;s death, 6th June, 1814, his
garden contained much that is remarkable in
horticulture:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;a
good collection of American plants; amongst others, a fine
<i>Andromeda Arborea</i>, planted about eight inches high in
March 1804; and now (1812) eleven feet eight inches high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Glastonbury Thorn</i> flowered here on Christmas
day, 1793.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the kitchen garden is (1812) a moss-rose, which has
been much admired.&nbsp; Many years ago Mr. Ord ordered his
gardener to lay a moss-rose, which, when done, he thought looked
so well, he would not allow the layers to be taken off, but laid
them down year after year, till it covered the ground it does at
present, viz. a diameter of forty-seven feet; want of room has
confined it to its present size for several years.&rdquo;</p>

145</span>Two agaves, or American aloes, flowered in Mr.
Ord&rsquo;s greenhouse in the summer of 1812, one of which was a
beautiful striped variety.&nbsp; The plants had been there since
the year 1756.&nbsp; Amid all these delightful associations,
there is one melancholy event connected with the place.&nbsp; On
the night of the 9th September, 1807, a fire broke out in the
garden-house of Mr. Ord&rsquo;s residence (a cottage upon the
site of the present stables): the flame raged so furiously as to
burn the principal gardener, an old and valued servant, almost to
ashes before any help could be afforded to him.&nbsp; Upon the
following Sunday (13th), the Rev. John Owen, the then curate of
Fulham, preached so effective a sermon upon the uncertainty of
the morrow, <a name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145"
class="citation">[145]</a> that having printed a large impression
&ldquo;without any loss to himself,&rdquo; a second edition
appeared on the 3rd of the following month.</p>
<p>In the second volume of the &lsquo;Transactions of the
Horticultural Society,&rsquo; a beautifully-coloured
representation of &lsquo;Ord&rsquo;s apple&rsquo; may be found,
illustrative of Mr. Salisbury&rsquo;s communication respecting
it, which was read to the Society on the 17th of January,
1817.&nbsp; After acknowledging his obligations to Mrs. Anne
Simpson, the sister of Mrs. Ord, and who Mr. Salisbury represents
as &ldquo;being as fond of gardening as her late brother-in-law,
Mr. Ord,&rdquo; it is stated that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;About forty years ago, the late John Ord,
Esq. raised, in his garden at <i>Purser&rsquo;s Cross</i>, near
Fulham, an apple-tree from the seed of the New-town pippin,
imported from North America.&nbsp; When this tree began to bear,
its fruit, though without any external beauty, proved remarkably
good, and had a peculiar quality, namely, a <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>melting
softness in eating, so that it might be said almost to dissolve
in the mouth.&nbsp; The late Mr. Lee, of Hammersmith, often had
grafts of this tree, and he sold the plant so raised first with
the name of Ord&rsquo;s apple, and subsequently with the name of
New-town pippin. . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seedling tree,&rdquo; continues Mr. Salisbury,
&ldquo;is now (1817) of large dimensions, its trunk being four
feet four inches round at a yard above the ground; but it has of
late years been very unhealthy, and scarcely borne any fruit
worth gathering, its roots having, no doubt, penetrated into a
stratum of unfavourable soil.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Anne Simpson sowed some pippins from this remarkable
tree,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And two of the healthiest seedlings of this
second generation were planted out to remain in the
kitchen-garden, which are now (1817) about twenty years
old.&nbsp; One of these trees began to bear fruit very soon,
which is not unlike that of its parent in shape, with a thin
skin; and, being a very good apple, grafts of it have been
distributed about the metropolis with the name of
<i>Simpson&rsquo;s pippin</i>.&nbsp; The other seedling of the
second generation was several years longer in bearing fruit; and,
when it did, the apples were quite of a different shape, being
long, with a thick skin and poor flavour, and so numerous as to
be all very small.&nbsp; Of late years, however, they have
gradually improved so much in flavour, as to become a remarkably
spirited, juicy apple, attaining a good size, which has probably
been promoted by thinning them, though a full crop has always
been left upon the tree; and they are now greatly esteemed by all
who taste them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This apple is in perfection for eating from Christmas to the
middle of March.&nbsp; The skin is thick, and always of a green
colour while on the tree, but tinged with copper-coloured red,
and several darker spots on the sunny side; after the fruit has
been gathered some time, the green colour changes to a yellowish
cast.&nbsp; It may be mentioned that, before the death of the
late Lord Ravensworth, the house was inhabited by those
celebrated artistes, Madame Grisi and Signor Mario.</p>
<p><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>On the opposite side of the road to Lord
Ravensworth&rsquo;s, and a few yards beyond it, on the way to
Fulham, is Walham Lodge, formerly Park Cottage, a modern
well-built house, which stands within extensive grounds,
surrounded by a brick wall.&nbsp; This was for some years the
residence of Mr. Brand, the eminent chemist, who particularly
distinguished himself by the course of lectures which he
delivered on geology, at the Royal Institution, in 1816; and
which may be dated as the popular starting point of that branch
of scientific inquiry in this country.</p>
<p>A house, now divided into two, and called Dungannon House and
Albany Lodge, abuts upon the western boundary wall of the grounds
of Walham Lodge.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p147.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=
"Dungannon House&mdash;Albany Lodge"

"Dungannon House&mdash;Albany Lodge"
src="images/p147.jpg" />
</a>Tradition stoutly asserts that this united cottage and villa
were, previous to their division, known by the name of
<i>Bolingbroke Lodge</i>, and that here Pope did, more than
once,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Awake my St. John,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>by an early morning visit.</p>
<p>At Albany Lodge, the farthest part of the old house in our
view (then Heckfield Villa), resided Mr. Milton, before-mentioned
as having lived at Heckfield Lodge, Little Chelsea; both of which
names were introduced on the Fulham Road, from that
gentleman&rsquo;s attachment to the name of his reverend
father&rsquo;s living, near Basingstoke.</p>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Dungannon House formerly went by the name of Acacia
Cottage, and was so called from a tree in the garden.&nbsp; It
was for many years the country residence of Mr. Joseph Johnson,
of St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, a publisher worthy of literary
regard; and here he died on the 20th of December, 1809.&nbsp; He
was born at Liverpool, in 1738; and, after serving an
apprenticeship in London, commenced business as a medical
bookseller, upon Fish Street Hill; &ldquo;a situation he chose as
being in the track of the medical students resorting to the
hospitals in the Borough, and which probably was the foundation
of his connexions with many eminent members of that
profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having entered into partnership, he removed to Paternoster
Row, where his house and stock were destroyed by fire, in 1770:
after which, feeling the advantage of a peculiar locality, he
carried on business alone, until the time of his death, at the
house which all juvenile readers who recollect the caterers for
their amusement and instruction will remember as that of
&ldquo;Harris and Co., corner of St. Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard.&rdquo;&nbsp; This step was considered at the time, by
&ldquo;the trade,&rdquo; as a bold and inconsiderate measure; but
it was successfully imitated by the late Mr. Murray, in his
removal from Fleet Street to Albemarle Street; and, indeed, John
Murray, as a publisher, seems only to have been a fearless
copyist, in many matters, of Joseph Johnson.&nbsp; Whether, as a
tradesman, he was judicious or not in so doing, is a question
upon which there may be two opinions; but there can be no
hesitation about the perfect application of Dr. Aikin&rsquo;s
words to both parties:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The character Mr. Johnson established by
his integrity, good <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>sense, and honourable principles of
dealing, soon raised him to eminence as a publisher; and many of
the most distinguished names in science and literature during the
last half century appear in works which he ushered to the
world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The imprint of Johnson is to be found upon the title-pages
which first introduced Cowper and Darwin to notice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The former of these, with the diffidence,
and perhaps the despondency, of his character, had actually, by
means of a friend, made over to him (Johnson) his two volumes of
poems, on no other condition than that of securing him from
expense; but when the public, which neglected the first volume,
had discovered the rich mine opened in the <i>Task</i>, and
assigned the author his merited place among the first-rate
English poets, Mr. Johnson would not avail himself of his
advantage, but displayed a liberality which has been warmly
acknowledged by that admirable, though unfortunate,
person.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A score of equally generous anecdotes might be told of
Murray.&nbsp; In one particular, however, there was, as
publishers, a decided difference between the views of Johnson and
Murray.&nbsp; Those of Johnson are at present in the ascendancy;
but they may produce a revolution in favour of the opinion of
John Murray against cheap literature.&nbsp; Johnson was the
opponent of typographical luxury.&nbsp; Murray, on the contrary,
supported the aristocracy of the press, until obliged, &ldquo;by
the pressure from without,&rdquo; in some degree to compromise
his views by the publication of the &lsquo;Family
Library.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the wing (comparatively speaking a modern addition)
attached to this house, and in the room where Mr. Johnson died,
is a remarkable chimney-piece, of a monumental character; but I
can learn nothing respecting it.</p>

</a> have passed through the human mind within its walls,
respecting literature and art, would form a chronicle of singular
interest.&nbsp; The late Mr. Hullmandel, well known as one of the
most experienced and successful practitioners of lithography in
England, resided here in 1839 and 1840, when he discovered a new
process in his favourite art, by simple mental reasoning, upon
the application of the process of copperplate aquatint to
lithographic purposes.&nbsp; For this discovery&mdash;and it is
one of considerable importance&mdash;he subsequently took out a
patent, under the name of lithotint.&nbsp; Ever since the infancy
of lithography, hundreds of persons connected with the art,
beginning with its inventor himself, Senefelder, had endeavoured
to produce impressions from stone of subjects executed with the
brush, in the same manner as drawings are made with sepia, or
Indian ink.&nbsp; <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>And it was natural enough that
artists should have made every effort to supersede the tedious
and elaborate process by which alone a liquid could be rendered
available for the purpose of drawing on stone.&nbsp; The mode of
drawing technically called &ldquo;the ink style,&rdquo; consists
merely of a series of lines, some finer, some thicker, executed
on the white surface of the stone, with ink dissolved in water,
by means of a fine sable or a steel pen, in imitation of an
etching on copper.&nbsp; All attempts, however, at producing
variety of tints, by using the ink thicker or thinner,
failed,&mdash;the fainter lines either disappearing altogether,
or printing as dark as thick ones.&nbsp; In every attempt made to
use this ink as a wash, the result was still more disastrous,
producing only one dirty mass of indistinctness, amid which the
original drawing was scarcely to be traced.&nbsp; For twenty
years did Mr. Hullmandel labour to attain some mode of printing
drawings, made by a series of washes, with a brush, on stone,
feeling this to be the great desideratum in the art.&nbsp;
Lithographers in Germany, in France, and in this country, had
pronounced it to be &ldquo;utterly impossible;&rdquo; when the
idea suddenly flashed upon him, that, if he could effect a minute
granulation of the ink, by treating it as a copperplate engraver
would the ground of an aquatint plate, the relative strength of
the different washes might be preserved.&nbsp; He hastened from
Acacia Cottage to his printing-office in London, to put his
theory into practice, and was rewarded by the most satisfactory
results.</p>
<p>Since that period, several prints, by this process of
lithotint, were produced by Mr. Hullmandel, from drawings made by
Harding, Nash, Haghe, Walton, and other clever <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>artists, in
which all the raciness, the smartness, and the beauty of touch,
are apparent, which hitherto could only be found in the original
drawing.&nbsp;

</a>In fact, lithotint was not a translation, but a
multiplication of the original; and its discovery, or, rather,
the proper application of knowledge, became an eventful era in
the history of the fine arts.</p>
<p>Arundel House, a few yards beyond Dungannon House, stands on
the same side of the road, opposite to Parson&rsquo;s Green Lane,
which leads to the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; It is a house of
considerable antiquity, judging from the stone mullions brought
to light by some repairs,&mdash;probably as old as the time of
Henry VIII.; although the brick front, as shown above, appears to
be the work of the latter part of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>The back of Arundel House is quite different in character, and
retains an <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>old porch leading into the
garden.&nbsp; At the farther end of the garden a venerable
yew-tree arbour exists; and not

</a> far from it used to stand a picturesque old pump, with the
date 1758 close to the spout; which pump is now removed, and a
new one put in its place.&nbsp; Upon a leaden cistern at the back
of Arundel House, the following monogram occurs beneath an
earl&rsquo;s coronet, with the date 1703:&mdash;
<a href="images/p153b.jpg">
<img class="clearcenter" alt=

</a>Notwithstanding that this is obviously compounded of the
letters L. I. C., or C. I. L., and at the first glance with the
<!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>connexion of an earl&rsquo;s coronet and a date would
appear to present no difficulty respecting the correct
appropriation, I must confess my inability to state to whom the
monogram belonged.&nbsp; For the name of Arundel I am equally
unable to account.&nbsp; No mention whatever is made of this
house by Mr. Faulkner; nor does the name of Arundel occur in the
parish records of Fulham, although in 1724, as before mentioned,
Stanley Grove House appears to have been in the possession of
Henry Arundel.&nbsp; In the midst of this obscurity, the
residence of the late Mr. Hallam, the historian, who occupied
Arundel House in 1819, invests it with a literary association of
interest.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the road is the carriage entrance to
Park House, which stands in Parson&rsquo;s Green Lane.&nbsp; A
stone tablet has been let into one of the piers of the gateway,
inscribed</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Purser&rsquo;s Cross</span>,<br />
7<span class="smcap">th August</span>,<br />
1738.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This date has reference to an occurrence which the monthly
chronologer in the &lsquo;London Magazine&rsquo; thus
relates:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An highwayman having committed several
robberies on Finchley Common, was pursued to London, when he
thought himself safe, but was, in a little time, discovered at a
public-house in Burlington Gardens, refreshing himself and his
horse; however, he had time to remount, and rode through Hyde
Park, in which there were several gentlemen&rsquo;s servants
airing their horses, who, taking the alarm, pursued him closely
as far as Fulham Fields, where, finding no probability of
escaping, he threw money among some country people who were at
work in the field, and told them they would soon see the end of
an unfortunate man.&nbsp; He had no sooner spoke these words but
he pulled <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>out a pistol, clapped it to his ear,
and shot himself directly, before his pursuers could prevent
him.&nbsp; The coroner&rsquo;s inquest brought in their verdict,
and he was buried in a cross road, with a stake drove through
him; but &rsquo;twas not known who he was.&rdquo; <a
name="citation155a"></a><a href="#footnote155a"
class="citation">[155a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the &lsquo;Beauties of England and Wales,&rsquo;
&ldquo;Purser&rsquo;s Cross&rdquo; is said to have been corrupted
from &ldquo;Parson&rsquo;s Cross,&rdquo; and the vicinity of
Parson&rsquo;s Green is mentioned in support of the
conjecture.&nbsp; However, that Purser, and not Percy Cross, has
been for many years the usual mode of writing the name of this
locality is established by the &lsquo;Annual Register&rsquo; for
1781, where the following remarkable coincidence is
mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Died, 30th December, 1780, at
Purser&rsquo;s Cross, Fulham, Mrs. Elizabeth and Mrs. Frances
Turberville, in the seventy-seventh year of their ages, of
ancient and respectable west country family; they were twin
sisters, and both died unmarried.&nbsp; What adds to the
singularity of this circumstance, they were both born the same
day, never were known to live separate, died within a few days of
each other, and were interred on the same day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Park House presents a fac-simile of an old mansion which stood
precisely on the same site, and was known as Quibus Hall, a name,
as is conjectured, bestowed upon it in consequence of some
dispute respecting possession between the coheirs of Sir Michael
Wharton, who died about 1725. <a name="citation155b"></a><a
href="#footnote155b" class="citation">[155b]</a>&nbsp; When
rebuilt by Mr. Holland for the late Mr. Powell, it was called
High Elms House, and was for some time occupied as a school,
conducted by the Rev. <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>Thomas Bowen, who published in 1798
&lsquo;Thoughts on the Necessity of Moral Discipline in
Prisons.&rsquo;&nbsp; After Mr. Bowen&rsquo;s death in the
following year, his widow, with the assistance of the Rev. Joshua
Ruddock, carried on the establishment until 1825, since which
time Park House became the occasional residence of Mr. Powell, of
Quex, in the Isle of Thanet, until his death in 1849.&nbsp; A
cottage opposite (formerly &ldquo;Brunswick Cottage&rdquo;) was
called &ldquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower,&rdquo; during the time the
late Mr. Crofton Croker lived in it (1837&ndash;46).</p>
<p>In a privately printed description of this cottage, when the
residence of Mr. Croker, of which but a very few copies were
distributed to his friends, Mr. Croker himself writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In what, it may be asked, originates the
romantic name of &lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower?&rsquo;&nbsp; A
question I shall endeavour to answer.&nbsp; The curious reader
will find from Lysons&rsquo; &lsquo;Environs of London&rsquo;
(II. 359), that the manor of Rosamonds is an estate near
Parson&rsquo;s Green, in the

</a><!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>parish of Fulham.&nbsp; Lysons adds,
&lsquo;the site of the mansion belonging to this estate, now
(1795) rented by a gardener, is said, by tradition, to have been
a palace of Fair Rosamond.&rsquo;&nbsp; There seems to be,
however, no foundation beyond the name for this tradition, and it
is unnoticed by Faulkner in his &lsquo;History of Fulham,&rsquo;
published in 1813.&nbsp; He merely mentions, adjoining High Elms,
or Park House, an old dwelling, which &lsquo;ancient
house,&rsquo; continues Faulkner, &lsquo;appears to be of the age
of Elizabeth, and is commonly called Rosamond&rsquo;s
Bower.&rsquo;&nbsp; This &lsquo;ancient house&rsquo; was taken
down by Mr. Powell, in the year 1826, and the present stables of
Park House are built upon the site.&nbsp; But I have recently
learned that the name of &lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Dairy&rsquo; is
still attached to an old house probably built between two and
three hundred years, which stands a little way back from the
high-road at the north-west corner of Parson&rsquo;s Green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always felt with Dr. Johnson that relics are
venerable things, and are only <i>not</i> to be worshipped.&nbsp;
When, therefore, I took my cottage, in 1837, and was told that
the oak staircase in it had belonged to the veritable
&lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower,&rsquo; and was the only relic of
it that existed; and when I found that the name had no longer a
precise &lsquo;local habitation&rsquo; in Fulham, I ventured,
purely from motives of respect for the memory of the past, and
not from any affectation of romance, to revive an ancient
parochial name which had been suffered to die out, &lsquo;like
the snuff of a candle.&rsquo;&nbsp; In changing its precise
situation, in transferring it from one side of Parson&rsquo;s
Green Lane to the other, a distance, however, not fifty yards
from the original site, I trust when called upon to show cause
for the transfer, to be reasonably supported by the history of
the old oak staircase.&nbsp; Indeed I may here venture to assert
that the change of name from &lsquo;Brunswick
Cottage,&rsquo;&mdash;so was &lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower&rsquo;
called when I took it,&mdash;and the assumption of that name, if
contrasted with the name changing and name travelling fashion of
the district, is a proceeding in which I am fully borne out by
numerous precedents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Edgeworth, in her reply, dated 31st January, 1840,
to the letter of a juvenile correspondent (then nine years of
age) inquires, &lsquo;Is Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower a real
name?&rsquo;&nbsp; And I well remember the gestures and even some
of the jests which the omnibus passengers made when
&lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower&rsquo; was first painted upon the
stone caps of the gate piers, such as Father Prout&rsquo;s
&lsquo;<i>Rosy</i>-man&rsquo;s Bower near the <i>White</i>
Sheaf&rsquo; (Wheatsheaf).&nbsp; But the novelty wore off in a
week or <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>two, and the name has long since
ceased to be an object of speculation to any but the
inquisitive.&nbsp; For their information I may state, that in the
time of Elizabeth all the gardeners&rsquo; cottages in this
neighbourhood were called bowers.&nbsp; It was the Saxon term for
a room, and, therefore, applied to the dwelling occupied by the
labouring class.&nbsp; And Rosamond, or Rosaman, is said to have
been the name of a family of gardeners bestowed upon the district
which they had long cultivated&mdash;possibly a sobriquet derived
from the fame of their roses in times when that flower was a
badge of party distinction. . . .&nbsp; It only remains for me to
add, that &lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower&rsquo; stands 22 feet
back from the high road, and has a small garden or court before
it, measuring, exclusive of the stable-yard, 63 feet.&nbsp; The
garden behind the house is of that form called a gore, gradually
narrowing from 63 to 22 feet, in a distance of 550 feet or 183
yards&mdash;five turns up and down which &lsquo;long walk&rsquo;
may be reckoned, by exercise meters, &lsquo;a full mile,&rsquo;
it being 73 yards over and above the distance, an ample allowance
for ten short turnings.&nbsp; Of the old &lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s
Bower&rsquo; three representations have been preserved; two of
these are pen-and-ink sketches by Mr. Doherty, made about the
middle of the last century, one of which is an authority for the
name of Pershouse Cross.&nbsp; The third view appears in a
well-executed aquatint plate of &lsquo;Fulham Park School taken
from the Play Ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foundation of the present &lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s
Bower,&rsquo; judging from the brickwork on the south side, and
the thickness of the walls, is probably as old as the time of
Elizabeth&mdash;I mean the original building which consisted of
two rooms, one above the other, 12 feet square, and 7 feet in
height.&nbsp; On the north side of this primitive dwelling was a
deep draw-well.&nbsp; Subsequently two similar rooms were
attached, one of which (the present hall) was built over the
well, and two attics were raised upon this very simple structure,
thus increasing the number of rooms from two to six.&nbsp; Then a
kitchen was built (the present dining-room), and another room
over it (the present drawing-room), at the back of the original
building, which thus from a labourer&rsquo;s hut assumed the air
of an eight-roomed cottage.&nbsp; It was then discovered that the
rooms were of very small dimensions, and it was considered
necessary to enlarge four of them by the additional space to be
gained from bay windows in the dining-room, drawing-room, blue
bedchamber, and dressing-room.&nbsp; But the spirit of
improvement seldom rests content, and when it was found that the
<!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>kitchen, which looked upon the garden, was a more
agreeable sitting-room, both as to aspect and quiet, than the
more ancient and smaller room which looked upon the road, it was
determined to create another attachment on the north side, by
building a kitchen of still larger dimensions, with a scullery
and storeroom behind, to replace the old scullery and out-offices
by a spacious staircase, and over this new kitchen to place a
room of corresponding size, or equal to that of the two bedrooms
upon the same line of building.&nbsp; Thus in 1826 did
&lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower&rsquo; become a cottage of ten
rooms; and as it was soon afterwards presumed from the march of
luxury that no one could live in a decade cottage without
requiring a coachhouse and stable, an excellent one was built not
far from the north side, making the third, though not the last,
addition in that direction.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">THE GARDEN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is much more difficult to describe the garden of
Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower than its shape.&nbsp; I may, however,
mention that by means of a sunk fence <a
name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159"
class="citation">[159]</a> and a wen-like excrescence upon the
original gore, made in the Spring of 1842, the extensive meadow
of Park House, with the piece of water which adorns it, appear to
belong to my residence so completely, that so far as the eye
questions the matter, &lsquo;I am monarch of all I
survey.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p159.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=

title=
"Distant View of &lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower&rsquo; from the

src="images/p159.jpg" />
</a>The first lawn of the garden rejoices in two very remarkable
trees, one a standard Ayrshire rose, rising ten feet in height
from a stem ten inches in circumference, and from which, during
sunny June, &lsquo;every breeze, of red rose leaves brings down a
<!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>crimson rain.&rsquo; <a name="citation160"></a><a
href="#footnote160" class="citation">[160]</a>&nbsp; The other a
weeping ash of singularly beautiful proportions.&nbsp; It has
been trained, or rather restrained, to the measurement of
fifty-six feet in circumference, the stem being two feet round,
and the branches shooting out at the height of five feet with
incredible luxuriance.&nbsp; Under its branches I had the
pleasure of seeing no less than thirty-eight friends sit down to
breakfast on the 22nd June, 1842; and Gunter, who laid covers for
forty-four, assured me, that another arrangement with circular
tables, made for the purpose, would have comfortably accommodated
sixty.&nbsp; A miniature shrubbery, not in height, but in
breadth, intervenes between the first lawn and the flower garden,
where, in the centre of beds, stands the &lsquo;Baylis
Vase&rsquo;&mdash;a memorial, I sincerely trust, of a more
enduring friendship.&nbsp; Miss Aikin&rsquo;s question&mdash;but
a very long acquaintance with that lady&rsquo;s fame warrants me
here writing &lsquo;Lucy Aikin&rsquo;s question&mdash;to me, one
evening while walking down the garden, whether that urn had been
placed over the remains of any favourite, was the occasion of the
following lines being painted on it:&mdash;</p>
<p>Think not that here was placed this urn<br />
To mark a spot o&rsquo;er which to mourn.<br />
Should tender thoughts awake a tear<br />
For fading flowers or waning year,<br />
Remember that another spring,<br />
Fresh flowers and brighter hopes will bring.</p>
<p>Two elevated strawberry beds, facetiously termed &lsquo;twin
strawberry hills,&rsquo; rear themselves between the vase and the
back lawn, the further corners of which are respectively
protected from wheelbarrow intrusion by an Irish Quern and a
Capsular Stone, venerated in Irish tradition&mdash;the former a
remarkably perfect, the latter an exceedingly compact specimen,
having on one side a double, and on the other a single hollow. .
. .&nbsp; The remaining points of interest in my garden may be
noticed in a very few words.&nbsp; It gradually decreases in
breadth, and is fenced off on one side from the garden of a very
kind neighbour (which contains two of the finest walnut trees in
the parish) by an oak paling partially covered with broad, or
Irish, and embellished by the picturesque narrow-leaved ivy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other side a trim hedge, kept breast high, which
runs beside &lsquo;the long walk,&rsquo; separates it from the
extensive meadow of <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Park House, and at the termination
the following inscription from one of Herrick&rsquo;s poems has
been placed&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine own dear grounds,<br
/>
Not envying others larger bounds,<br />
For well thou knowest &rsquo;tis not the extent<br />
Of land makes life, but sweet content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The garden produces plenty of strawberries, an
abundance of raspberries, and generally a good crop of apples and
pears, but few vegetables; the cultivation, except of asparagus
(of which there are two excellent beds), having been abandoned,
as the bird monopoly of peas, caused every shilling&rsquo;s worth
that came to table to cost five, and the ingenuity of the slugs
and snails having completely baffled all amateur gardening
schemes of defence against their slimy invasions.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p161.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=
"Rustic bench"
title=
"Rustic bench"
src="images/p161.jpg" />
</a>Among many experiments I may mention one.&nbsp; Some
vegetables were protected by a circumvallum of salt; but,
notwithstanding, the slugs and snails contrived to pass this
supposed deadly line of demarcation by fixing themselves on dry
leaves which they could easily lift, and thus they wriggled
safely over it.&nbsp; My greatest enjoyment in the garden has
been derived from a rustic bench at the north side of the
shrubbery, through the back and arms of which a honeysuckle has
luxuriantly interlaced itself; there, particularly when
recovering from illness, I have sat, and have found, or fancied,
that pain was soothed, and depressed spirits greatly elevated, by
the monotonous tone of the bees around me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pamphlet from which the above has been taken then enters
into a minute description of the curiosities, pictures, &amp;c.,
collected by Mr. Croker at &lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower,&rsquo;
which it is unnecessary further to refer to; indeed, although
intended for private circulation only, it was not completed, as
Mr. Croker was led to believe it might appear but an egotistical
description of an unimportant house.</p>
<p>The following particulars, connected with Thomas <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Moore&rsquo;s visit to &lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s
Bower,&rsquo; may prove interesting:&mdash;</p>
<p>On the 6th October, 1838, Moore wrote to Mr. Crofton Croker as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Many thanks for your wish to have me at
Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower, even though I was unlucky enough not to
profit by that wish&mdash;some other time, however, you must, for
<i>my</i> sake, try again; and I shall then be most ready for a
rummage of your Irish treasures.&nbsp; Already, indeed, I have
been drawing a little upon your &lsquo;Researches in the South of
Ireland;&rsquo; and should be very glad to have more books of
yours to pilfer.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours, my dear Mr. Croker,<br
/>
&ldquo;Very truly,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thomas Moore</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 18th November, 1841, Major-General (then Colonel) Sir
Charles O&rsquo;Donnell lunched at Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower; before
luncheon Mr. Croker happened to point out to him the passage in
the preface of the fourth volume of Moore&rsquo;s Works, p. xxxv,
in which the poet says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With the melody entitled, &lsquo;Love,
Valour, and Wit,&rsquo; an incident is connected, which awakened
feelings in me of proud, but sad pleasure, to think that my songs
had reached the hearts of some of the descendants of those great
Irish families, who found themselves forced, in the dark days of
persecution, to seek in other lands a refuge from the shame and
ruin of their own;&mdash;those whose story I have associated with
one of their country&rsquo;s most characteristic airs:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye Blakes and O&rsquo;Donnells, whose fathers
resign&rsquo;d<br />
The green hills of their youth, among strangers to find<br />
That repose which at home they had sigh&rsquo;d for in
vain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a foreign lady, of this ancient
extraction,&mdash;whose names, could I venture to mention them,
would lend to the incident an additional Irish charm,&mdash;I
received about two years since, through the hands of a gentleman
to whom it had been intrusted, a large portfolio, adorned inside
with a beautiful drawing representing Love, Wit, and Valour, as
described in the song.&nbsp; In the border that surrounds the
drawing <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>are introduced the favourite emblems
of Erin, the harp, the shamrock, the mitred head of St. Patrick,
together with scrolls containing each, inscribed in letters of
gold, the name of some favourite melody of the fair artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This present was accompanied by the following letter
from the lady herself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unnecessary to quote this letter, but the gentleman
alluded to was Sir Charles O&rsquo;Donnell, who had brought the
parcel from the Continent, and being about to proceed to Canada,
and personally unacquainted with Moore, requested Mr. Croker to
get it safely delivered; who took the present opportunity of
pointing out to Sir Charles this public acknowledgment that his
commission had been executed.</p>
<p>They had not been at luncheon many minutes when Mr. Moore was
announced, and appeared to be no less pleased at meeting Sir
Charles O&rsquo;Donnell, than the latter was at being introduced
to Moore.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards, Mr. Croker received the following note
from Mr. Moore:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>November</i> 24, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Croker</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was obliged to leave London much sooner than I
originally intended, and thus lost the opportunity of paying you
another visit. . . .&nbsp; My next visit to London will, I hope,
be sufficiently free from other avocations to allow me to devote
a good deal of time to the examination of your various
treasures.&nbsp; Pray give my kind remembrances to Mrs.
Croker.&mdash;I constantly think of my great good luck in
lighting by chance on so agreeable a dinner-party that day.&nbsp;
The only drawback was, that it spoiled me&mdash;both mentally and
physically speaking&mdash;for the dinner that followed.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours very truly,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thomas Moore</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name of <span class="smcap">Moore</span> was subsequently
cut by Mr. Croker on the back of a chair which the poet occupied
during this <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>visit.&nbsp; It produced the
following epigram by the Rev. Francis Mahony (Father
Prout):&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;This is to tell o&rsquo; days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When on this Cathedra,<br />
He of the Melodies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Solemnly sat, agrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas James Bell, the next tenant of
&lsquo;Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower,&rsquo; altered the name to
&lsquo;Audley Cottage,&rsquo; which it now bears, and the
agreeable associations connected with the former title are in the
recollection of many who may be unaware of the change, and may
regret the substitution of a name, for which there appears to
have been very little reason.</p>
<p>Parson&rsquo;s Green Lane continues from Rosamond&rsquo;s
Bower to Parson&rsquo;s Green.&nbsp; It is for the most part
composed of small cottages.&nbsp; On the left-hand corner of the
Green is the &lsquo;White Horse&rsquo; public-house, the sign of
which was, some few years ago supported by the quaint piece of
iron-work shown in the annexed cut.&nbsp; It is now altered.</p>

</a></p>
<p>East End House, on the east side of the Green, next the <!--
page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>pond, was originally built by Sir Francis Child, who
was Lord Mayor of London, in 1699.&nbsp; It was afterwards the
residence of Admiral Sir Charles Wager; and Dr. Ekins, Dean of
Carlisle, died here 20th November, 1791.&nbsp; The house was
subsequently modernized by the late John Powell, and became the
residence of Mrs. Fitzherbert, who erected the porch in front of
the house as a shelter for carriages.&nbsp; Here the Prince of
Wales (afterwards George IV.) was a frequent visitor.&nbsp;
Piccolomini lived here for a short time lately.</p>
<p>The celebrated Sir Thomas Bodley lived at Parson&rsquo;s Green
from 1605 to 1609.&nbsp; The old mansion at the west side of the
Green was formerly the Rectory House, and is traditionally
reported to have been the residence of Adoniram Byfield, the
noted Presbyterian Chaplain to Colonel Cholmondeley&rsquo;s
regiment in the Earl of Essex&rsquo;s army, who took so prominent
a part in Cromwellian politics, that he became immortalized in
Hudibras.&nbsp;

</a>An old stone building is noticed by Bowack in 1705, as
adjoining this house, and presumed by him to be of three or four
hundred years&rsquo; standing, and in all probability a chapel
for the rectors and their domestics.&nbsp; This building was
pulled down, according to Lysons, about the <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>year 1742,
and the house is now divided into two, that at the corner being
occupied by Dr. Lauman&rsquo;s Academy.&nbsp; At the south-west
side of the Green is the old entrance to Peterborough House, a
residence with the recollections of which the names of Locke,
Swift, Pope, Gay, Prior, and a crowd of others are
associated.</p>
<p>The present Peterborough House, which is a little beyond the
old brick gateway, was built by Mr. J. Meyrick, who died there in
1801.&nbsp; Ho was the father of Sir Samuel Meyrick the
well-known antiquary.&nbsp; Ho purchased the house, in 1794, of
R. Heavyside, Esq., and pulled down the old mansion that stood
close to the site of the ancient maze, which became converted
into a lawn at the rear of the modern house.&nbsp; The place was
originally 
<a href="images/p166.jpg">
<img class="clearcenter" alt=

title=

src="images/p166.jpg" />
</a> termed Brightwells, or Rightwells, and here, in 1569, died
John Tarnworth, Esq., one of Elizabeth&rsquo;s privy counsellors,
who lies buried at Fulham.</p>
<p>Brightwells afterwards belonged to Sir Thomas Knolles, <!--
page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>who, in 1603, sold it to Sir Thomas Smith, who had been
secretary to the unfortunate Earl of Essex, and became, under
James I., Clerk of the Council, Latin Secretary, and Master of
the Requests; and here he died in 1609, and was buried in the
chancel of Fulham Church, where a handsome monument is erected to
his memory.&nbsp; After Sir Thomas Smith&rsquo;s death, his widow
married the first Earl of Exeter, and continued to reside at
Brightwells until her death, in 1633.&nbsp; Sir Thomas
Smith&rsquo;s only daughter having married the Honourable Thomas
Carey, the Earl of Monmouth&rsquo;s second son, he became
possessed of the estate in right of his wife, and after him the
place was called Villa Carey, which has led to the belief that
old Peterborough House was built by him.&nbsp; It stood facing
the pond on Parson&rsquo;s Green, and at about the same distance
from the road as the present house.&nbsp; Francis Cleyne, who
came over to England in the reign of Charles I., was certainly
employed to decorate the rooms.&nbsp; Mr. Carey died about 1635;
and his widow, about five years afterwards, married Sir Edward
Herbert, Attorney-General to King Charles.&nbsp; Sir Edward was a
firm loyalist, and resided at Parson&rsquo;s Green till the death
of his royal master, when he accompanied Charles II. in his
exile, who created him Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and he died
abroad in 1657.&nbsp; His estate was ordered to be sold with the
estates of other loyalists in 1653, but the sale does not appear
to have taken place, as Villa Carey, in 1660, was in the
possession of Lord Mordaunt, who had married the daughter and
heiress of Mr. Carey.&nbsp; Lord Clarendon bears honourable
testimony to the daring spirit and devoted zeal <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>in
the royal cause evinced by this &ldquo;young gentleman,&rdquo;
and to the no less chivalric conduct of his charming bride.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was,&rdquo; says the historian,
&ldquo;of great vigour of mind, and newly married to a young and
beautiful lady of a very loyal spirit and notable vivacity of wit
and humour, who concurred with him in all honourable dedications
of himself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When her husband was arrested and brought to trial in 1658, as
a partizan of Charles II., by her contrivance one of the
principal witnesses against him was kept out of the way, and his
judges, being divided in their opinion of his guilt, he was
acquitted only by the casting vote of the President, the
notorious John Lisle, who had sat upon the trial of Charles I.,
by whom he was addressed in the following remarkable
strain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And I have now to speak to you Mr.
Mordaunt: God hath appeared in justice, and God doth appear in
mercy, as the Lord is just to them, so the Lord is exceeding
merciful to you, and I may say to you that God appears to you at
this time, as he speaks to sinners in Jesus Christ, for Sir, he
doth clear sinners in Christ Jesus even when they are guilty, and
so God cleareth you.&nbsp; I will not say you are guilty, but ask
your own conscience whether you are or no.&nbsp; Sir, bless God
as long as you live, and bless my Lord Protector, by whose
authority you are cleared.&nbsp; Sir, I speak no more, but I
beseech you to speak to God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The very active part which Lord Mordaunt had taken in
effecting the restoration of Charles II., in which service,
according to his epitaph, he &ldquo;encountered a thousand
dangers, provoking and also defeating the rage of
Cromwell,&rdquo; was not rewarded by any extraordinary marks of
distinction or favour, and he seems after that event to have
quietly resided on his estate at Parson&rsquo;s Green, where he
died in the forty-eighth year of his age, <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>on the 5th
June, 1675, and was buried in Fulham Church.&nbsp; The son of
Lord Mordaunt, who afterwards received the title of Earl of
Peterborough, married first, Carey, daughter to Sir Alexander
Fraser, of Dover.&nbsp; His second wife was the accomplished
singer Anastasia Robinson, who survived him.&nbsp; The earl was
visited at Peterborough House by all the wits and literati of his
time.&nbsp; Bowack, in 1706, describes the gardens of
Peterborough House, as containing twenty acres of ground, and
mentions a tulip-tree seventy-six feet in height, and five feet
nine inches in girth.&nbsp; Swift, in one of his letters, speaks
of Lord Peterborough&rsquo;s gardens as the finest he had ever
seen about London.</p>
<p>On the same side of the Green as Peterborough House, stood the
residence of Samuel Richardson, who removed to Parson&rsquo;s
Green from North End in 1755, and in this house his second wife,
who survived him, died in November, 1773, aged
seventy-seven.&nbsp; Formerly the same house belonged to Sir
Edward Saunders, Lord Chief Justice of the King&rsquo;s Bench in
1682.&nbsp; A sketch of the house will be found in
Chambers&rsquo; Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature.&nbsp;
Drury Lodge, situated on the King&rsquo;s Road adjoining
Parson&rsquo;s Green, and immediately opposite the Malt House,
formerly known as Ivy Cottage, was built by Walsh Porter in the
Gothic style, and is now the residence of Mr. E. T. Smith, who
has called the house after his theatre.&nbsp; The name of the
lane which runs down by the side of Drury Lodge has, however, not
been altered to <i>Drury</i> Lane, but still retains its old
title of Broom Lane.</p>
<p>It is said that on the site of what is now called Drury <!--
page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Lodge, was formerly a house, the residence of Oliver
Cromwell, which was called the <i>Old Red Ivy House</i>.&nbsp;
Part of the old walls of that building form the west side of the
present cottage.</p>
<p>Proceeding forward from Purser&rsquo;s Cross on the main
Fulham Road, where St. Peter&rsquo;s Villa may be noticed as the
residence of Madame Garcia in 1842, about a quarter of a mile
brings us to Munster House, which is supposed to owe its name to
Melesina Schulenberg, created by George II., in 1716, Duchess of
Munster.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p170.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=

</a>According to Faulkner, it was also called <i>Mustow</i>
House&mdash;this was not improbably the duchess&rsquo;s
pronunciation; and he adds that tradition makes it a hunting-seat
of Charles II., and asserts that an extensive park was attached
to it; but Faulkner also tells us that Munster House &ldquo;was
during the greater part of the seventeenth century, the
<i>residence</i> and property of Sir William Powell, Bart., who
founded the almshouses.&rdquo;&nbsp; How, after this statement,
Mr. Faulkner could have admitted the tradition, requires some
explanation, as he seems to have followed, without
acknowledgment, the particulars supplied to Lysons from authentic
documents by Mr. Deere, of the Auditor&rsquo;s Office, who
appears merely to have informed <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>that
gentleman, that among the title-deeds of this property there is
one of Sir Edward Powell&rsquo;s, dated 1640, and that Sir
William Powell&rsquo;s will bears date 1680.&nbsp; According to
the same unquestionable records, Munster House came from the
Powells into the possession of Sir John Williams, Bart., of
Pengethly, Monmouthshire.</p>
<p>In 1795, Lysons says that Munster House was &ldquo;occupied as
a school.&rdquo;&nbsp; Faulkner, in 1813, states that it was
&ldquo;in the occupation of M. Sampayo, a Portuguese
merchant.&rdquo;&nbsp; And his successor in the tenancy was John
Wilson Croker, Esq., M.P., then secretary of the Admiralty, and
afterwards the Right Hon. Mr. Croker, <a
name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a> a gentleman who brilliantly retired
into private life, but whose character is so well known, and has
been so often discussed in political and literary circles, that I
shall only venture to remark the local coincidence of three
indefatigable secretaries of the Admiralty, during the most
critical periods of England&rsquo;s history&mdash;namely, Sir
Philip Stevens, Sir Evan Nepean, and Mr. Croker&mdash;having
selected the quietude of Fulham as the most convenient and
attractive position in the neighbourhood of London, where they
might momentarily relax from the arduous strain of official
duties.</p>

<p>About 1820, Mr. Croker resigned Munster House as a residence,
after having externally decorated it with various Cockney
embattlements of brick, and collected there many curious works of
art, possibly with a view of reconstruction.&nbsp; <!-- page

the garden were two marble busts, one of which is figured on
previous page.&nbsp; The other a female head, not unlike that of
Queen Anne.</p>
<p>There was also a fragment of a group, representing a woman
with a child at her side, obviously the decoration of a fountain,
and a rustic stone seat, conjectured to have been the bed of a
formidable piece of ordnance.</p>

<p>A recent tenant of Munster House, the Rev. Stephen Reid
Cattley, who is known to the reading public as the editor of an
issue of Fox&rsquo;s &lsquo;Book of Martyrs,&rsquo; was
unacquainted with the history of the relics in the garden, and
can only remember the removal of two composition lions from the
gate-piers of Munster House,&mdash;not placed there, it must be
observed, by Mr. Croker, but which had the popular effect, for
some time, of changing the name to <i>Monster House</i>.&nbsp; It
is now a Lunatic Asylum.&nbsp; Opposite Munster House is
Dancer&rsquo;s extensive garden for the supply of the London
market, by the side of which a road runs leading by a turning on
the left direct back to Parson&rsquo;s Green, or if the straight
road is kept, the King&rsquo;s Road is reached opposite
Osborn&rsquo;s Nursery; adjoining which <!-- page 173--><a

</a>Fulham Lodge stood on the opposite, or south side, of the
road from Munster House, on the ground immediately beyond Munster
Terrace, which was built a short time prior to its
demolition.&nbsp; This cottage, for it was no more, was a
favourite retirement of the late Duke of York.&nbsp; An affecting
story is told by George Colman the younger, connected with his
own feelings while on a visit here.&nbsp; He had lost sight of an
old college friend, the Rev. Robert Lowth, son of the Bishop of
London, from the year 1781 to 1822 (one and forty years!), when
Colman was surprised and pleased by the receipt of the following
letter, written and left upon his table by a gentleman who had
called when he was not at home:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>August</i> 16,
1822.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Colman</span>,&mdash;It may be
some five-and-thirty years since we met, and I believe as near
forty years as may be since I was promoted from my garret, No. 3
Peckwater, into your <i>ci-devant</i> rooms in the old Quad, on
which occasion I bought your things.&nbsp; Of all your household
furniture I possess but one article, which I removed with myself
to my first house and castle in Essex, as a very befitting
parsonage sideboard, viz., a mahogany table, with two side
drawers, and which still &lsquo;does the state some
service,&rsquo; though not of plate.&nbsp; But I have an article
of yours on a smaller scale, a certain little flat mahogany box,
furnished partially, I should say, with cakes of paint, which
probably you <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>over-looked, or undervalued as a
<i>vade-mecum</i>, and left.&nbsp; And, as an exemplification of
the great vanity of over-anxious care, and the safe preservation
<i>per contra</i>, in which an article may possibly be found
without any care at all, that paint-box is still <i>in statu
quo</i>, at this present writing, having run the gauntlet, not
merely of my bachelor days, but of the practical cruelties of my
thirteen children, all alive and merry, thank God! albeit as
unused and as little disposed to preserve their own playthings or
chattels from damage as children usually are, yet it
survives!&nbsp; &lsquo;The reason why I cannot tell,&rsquo;
unless I kept it &lsquo;for the dangers it had passed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though I have been well acquainted with you publicly
nearly ever since our Christ Church days, our habits, pursuits,
and callings, having cast us into different countries and tracts,
we have not, I think met since the date I speak of.&nbsp; I have
a house at Chiswick, where I rather think this nine-lived box is,
and, whether it is or no, I shall be very glad if you will give
me a call to dine, and take a bed, if convenient to you; and if I
cannot introduce you to your old acquaintance and recollections,
I shall have great pleasure in substituting new ones,&mdash;Mrs.
Lowth and eleven of our baker&rsquo;s dozen of olive-branches,
our present complement in the house department, my eldest boy
being in the West Indies, and my third having returned to the
military college last Saturday, his vacation furlough having
expired.&nbsp; As the summer begins to borrow now and then an
autumn evening, the sooner you will favour me with your company
the surer you will be of finding me at Grove House, the
expiration of other holidays being the usual signal for weighing
anchor and shifting our moorings to parsonage point.&nbsp; I
remember you, or David Curson, had among your phrases,
<i>quondam</i>, one of anything being &lsquo;d---d
summerly;&rsquo; I trust, however, having since tasted the
delights of the sweet shady side of Pall Mall, that you have worn
out that prejudice, and will catch the season before it flies us,
or give me a line, naming no distant day, that I may not be
elsewhere when you call, and you will much oblige, yours
sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robert
Lowth</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;In your address to me you must not name
<i>Chiswick</i>, but Grove House, Turnham Green, as otherwise it
goes into another postman&rsquo;s walk, who walks it back again
to the office, and it does not reach me, per Turnham Green,
peripatetic, till the next day, which is <i>toute autre
chose</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>Colman seems to have been sincerely delighted at the
receipt of this letter; he answered it immediately, expressing to
his old friend how much he had gratified him, and how readily he
accepted the invitation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After refreshing my friend&rsquo;s
memory,&rdquo; says Colman, &ldquo;by touching on some
particulars which have already been mentioned, I informed him
that I was of late years in the habit of suburban rustication,
and that I had passed a considerable part of my summers in a
house where I was intimate at Fulham, whither I desired him to
direct to me, as much nearer Chiswick than my own abode, being
within a few hundred yards of his old family residence, where we
last parted.&nbsp; Whenever I was at this place, I told him the
avenue and bishop&rsquo;s walk by the river side, the public
precincts of the moated episcopal domain, had become my favourite
morning and evening lounge.&nbsp; I told him, indeed, merely the
fact, omitting all commentary attached to it, for often had I
then, and oftener have I since, in a solitary stroll down the
avenue, thought of him, regretting the wide chasm in our
intercourse, and musing upon human events.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a regret expressed by Colman that he kept no copy of
his answer, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;was written in
the &lsquo;flow of soul,&rsquo; and at the impulse of the
moment?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Lowth wrote in reply to Colman,
detailing in a most amusing manner his having, in the pursuit of
two Cockneys, who had made an attack upon a grove of Orleans
plum-trees in his grounds, taken cold, which confined him to his
room.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But for this <i>inter poculum et
labra</i>,&rdquo; continued Mr. Lowth, &ldquo;it was my intention
to have made you my first <i>post restante</i>, with, perhaps, a
walk down the old avenue, in my way to town, that identical day;
and, still hoping to accomplish three miles and back, I have
hoped from day to day, but I cannot get in travelling condition,
even for so short a journey.&nbsp; Therefore I hope you will send
me word by my new Yorkshire groom lad, that you will take
pot-luck with me on Sunday as the most likely day for you to
suburbise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>Colman accepted the invitation, believing from the
length of Mr. Lowth&rsquo;s letter (three pages), and the
playfulness of his old friend&rsquo;s communication, that nothing
more than an ordinary cold was the matter with him.&nbsp; A note,
however, which followed from one of Mr. Lowth&rsquo;s daughters,
stated that the meeting proposed by her father must be postponed,
that he &ldquo;had become extremely unwell, that bleeding and
cupping had been prescribed,&rdquo; and the most perfect quiet
enjoined.</p>
<p>On the day after the receipt of this note, Colman sent over to
Grove House, Chiswick, to make inquiries as to Mr. Lowth&rsquo;s
health, when the reply given by an elderly female at the gate,
after considerable delay, was that &ldquo;her master was no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A letter from Dr. Badeley to Colman, dated 22d August, 1822,
confirmed the melancholy intelligence, which he had at first
hesitated to believe.&nbsp; It stated that &ldquo;the decease of
Mr. Lowth took place on Sunday evening,&rdquo; the very evening
appointed by him for their anticipated happy reunion; and that
his remains were to be interred in the family vault at Fulham on
Monday morning at ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I continued,&rdquo; said Colman, &ldquo;at
Fulham Lodge, which is nearer in a direct line to the church than
to the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace and the &lsquo;old
avenue.&rsquo;&nbsp; On Monday the adjacent steeple gave early
notice of the approaching funeral; religion and sorrow mingled
within me while the slow and mournful tolling of the bell smote
upon my heart.&nbsp; Selfish feelings, too, though secondary,
might now and then obtrude, for they are implanted in our
nature.&nbsp; My departed friend was about my own age: we had
entered the field nearly at the same time; we had fought, indeed,
our chief battles asunder, but in our younger days he had been my
comrade, close to me in the ranks: he had fallen, and my own turn
might speedily follow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>These are the ideas which George Colman the younger
records as having passed through his mind while an inmate of
Fulham Lodge:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My walk next morning,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;was to the sepulchre of the Lowths, to indulge in the
mournful satisfaction of viewing the depository of my poor
friend&rsquo;s remains.&nbsp; It stands in the churchyard, a few
paces from the eastern end of the ancient church at Fulham.&nbsp;
The surrounding earth, trampled by recent footsteps, and a slab
of marble which had been evidently taken out and replaced in the
side of the tomb, too plainly presented traces of those rites,
which had been performed on the previous day.&nbsp; For several
mornings I repeated my walk thither, and no summer has since
glided away, except the last, when my sojournment at Fulham was
suspended, without my visiting the spot and heaving a sigh to the
memory of Robert Lowth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theodore Hook&rsquo;s manuscript Diary contains the following
entries with reference to visits made by him at Fulham
Lodge:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;2nd January, 1826.&mdash;Called.&nbsp; Mrs.
Carey&rsquo;s luncheon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thursday, 5th January.&mdash;Drove over to
Fulham.&nbsp; Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s din.&nbsp; Colman, Harris, Mrs.
G.&nbsp; Good hits.&nbsp; Mrs. Coutts, &lsquo;Julius
C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Stayed very late, and walked
home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fulham Park Road is now where Fulham Lodge stood, and the
ground is partly built on, the rest is to be let for
building.</p>
<p>This walk is exactly three miles and a half from Hyde Park
Corner; and what an Irishman would call the iron mile-stone stood
exactly opposite to Ivy Lodge, until placed against the brick
wall immediately beyond the railings.</p>
<p>Ivy Lodge was for some years the residence of Rudolph
Ackermann, a name, as a printseller, known (it is not <!-- page
178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>using too broad a word to say) throughout the world,
and whose representatives still carry on this business in Regent
Street.</p>
<p>Ackermann was a remarkable man.&nbsp; He was born in 1764, at
Stollberg, near Schneeberg, in Saxony; and, having been bred a
coach-builder, upon visiting England shortly before the French
Revolution, found employment as a carriage-draughtsman, which led
to his forming the acquaintance of artists, and becoming a
print-publisher in London.&nbsp; The French refugees, whose
necessities obliged them to exercise their acquirements and
talents as a means of support, found in Mr. Ackermann&rsquo;s
shop a repository for the exhibition and sale of decorative
articles, which elevated this branch of business to an importance
that it had never before assumed in England.&nbsp;
Ackermann&rsquo;s name stands prominently forward in the early
history of gas and lithography in England, and he must be
remembered as the introducer of a species of illustrated
periodicals, by the publication of the
&lsquo;Forget-Me-Not;&rsquo; to which, or to similar works,
nearly every honoured contemporary name in the whole circle of
British literature have contributed, and which have produced a
certain, but advantageously a questionable, influence upon the
Fine Arts.</p>
<p>After the battle of Leipzig, Mr. Ackermann publicly advocated
the cause of the starving population of many districts of
Germany, in consequence of the calamities of war, with so much
zeal and success, that a parliamentary grant of &pound;100,000
was more than doubled by a public subscription.&nbsp; In the
spring of 1830, when residing at Ivy Lodge, he experienced a
sudden attack of paralysis; and a <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>change of
air was recommended by his medical attendants.&nbsp; This led to
Mr. Ackermann&rsquo;s removal to Finchley, where he died on the
30th of March, 1834.</p>
<p>Having now arrived at Fulham, we will in the next chapter
accompany the reader in a walk through that ancient village.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">fulham</span>.</p>
<p>In Faulkner&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of Fulham&rsquo; we learn
that the earliest mention of that village occurs in a grant of
the manor by Tyrhtilus Bishop of Hereford, to Erkenwald Bishop of
London, and his successors, about the year 691; in which grant it
is called <i>Fulanham</i>.&nbsp; Camden in his
&lsquo;Britannia&rsquo; calls it <i>Fulham</i>, and derives its
name from the Saxon word <i>Fulanham</i>, <i>Volucrum Domus</i>,
the habitation of birds or place of fowls.&nbsp; Norden agrees
with Camden, and adds, &ldquo;It may also be taken for
<i>Volucrum Amnis</i>, or the river of fowl; for <i>Ham</i> also
in many places signifies <i>Amnis</i>, a river, but it is most
probable it should be of land fowl, which usually haunt groves
and clusters of trees, whereof in this place it seemeth hath been
plenty.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Somner&rsquo;s and Lye&rsquo;s Saxon
dictionaries it is called Fulanham, or Foulham, supposed from the
dirtiness of the place.&nbsp; The earliest historical event
relating to Fulham, is the arrival of the Danes there in the year
879.&nbsp; On the right hand side as we enter the village stands
Holcrofts&rsquo; <i>Hall</i> (formerly Holcrofts&rsquo;) built
about 1708, which is worthy of mention as belonging to John
Laurie, Esq., and as having been <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>the
residence of Sir John Burgoyne, where he gave some clever
dramatic performances, distinguished not only for the
considerable talent displayed by the actors, but remarkable for
the scenery and machinery, considering the limited space, the
whole of which was superintended by the Honourable Mr.
Wrottesley, son of Lord Wrottesley, who afterwards married Miss
Burgoyne, an admirable amateur actress: here it was that the
celebrated Madame Vestris died, on the 8th August, 1856, in her
59th year.&nbsp; During the time she lived there it was called
Gore Lodge.&nbsp; The house has been since tenanted for a short
time by Mr. Charles Mathews and his present wife.&nbsp;
Holcroft&rsquo;s Priory, which is opposite, was built upon the
site of Claybrooke House, mentioned by Faulkner.&nbsp; In the
back lane (Burlington Road) Fulham Almshouses are situated,
opposite to Burlington House, formerly Roy&rsquo;s well-known
academy, on the ground attached to which is now a Reformatory
School, built about four years ago.&nbsp; This lane leads to the
termination of the King&rsquo;s Road by the Ship Tavern.&nbsp;
The Almshouses were originally built and endowed by Sir W.
Powell, Bart., and were rebuilt in 1793.&nbsp; The old workhouse
(built 1774) still stands on the left-hand side of the High
Street.&nbsp; It has been in a dilapidated condition for many
years, and is about to be pulled down.&nbsp; The Fulham and
Hammersmith Union is now in Fulham Fields.&nbsp; Cipriani lived
in a house adjoining the workhouse.&nbsp; Further on in Fulham
High Street is the Golden Lion Inn.&nbsp; There is a tradition
that Bishop Bonner resided in the Old Golden Lion, and that it
had a subterranean communication with the palace.&nbsp; The late
Mr. Crofton Croker <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>read the following paper at the
meeting of the British Arch&aelig;ological Association at Warwick
in 1847:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">On
the probability of the Golden Lion Inn</span>, <span
class="smcap">at Fulham</span>, <span class="smcap">having been
frequented by Shakespeare about the years</span> 1595 <span
class="smcap">and</span> 1596.</p>
<p>It is certainly extraordinary that of the personal history of
a man whose writings are of so high an order of genius that they
may almost be considered as works of inspiration, we should know
so little, and that conjecture should have to supply so much, as
in the biography of William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Pilgrims as are we at this moment to the birth-place and the
tomb of the highest name in the literature of this country, we
all feel that we now tread the classic ground of
England&mdash;ground too rich in unquestionable memories of
Shakespeare, to admit of any feeling of jealousy in an attempt to
connect his fame by circumstantial evidence with any other
locality.&nbsp; I therefore venture to call attention to the two
following entries in the parish records of Fulham, a village in
the county of Middlesex, on the Thames, about four miles west of
London, and where the Bishop of London has a seat.</p>
<p>In an assessment made on the 12th October, 1625, for the
relief of the poor of Fulham side, John Florio, Esq., was rated
at six shillings, for his house in Fulham Street.</p>
<p>And in the same assessment upon the &ldquo;Northend&rdquo; of
the parish, the name of Robert Burbage occurs.</p>
<p>Meagre as this appears to be, and wide of the date at which I
aim by thirty years, it is all that I can produce in the shape of
novel documentary evidence for an attempt to connect the name of
Shakespeare with Fulham; the other points which I have to offer
in evidence being admitted facts, although no result has been
deduced from them.</p>
<p>In the High Street of Fulham stands a cleanly-looking brick
house, square in form and newly built, called the Golden Lion,
where any suburban traveller requiring refreshment may be
supplied with a mug of excellent ale and bread and cheese, in a
parlour having a sanded floor, the room, it must be confessed,
smelling rather strongly of tobacco smoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may break, you may ruin the vase if you
will&mdash;<br />
But the scent of the roses will hang round it
still;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>And so it is, to my mind, with the tobacco smoke of the
Golden Lion, which stands upon the site of an old hostelry, or
inn, of the Tudor age, which was pulled down in April, 1836, and
was described soon afterwards in the &lsquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine.&rsquo;&nbsp; While the work of destruction 
<a href="images/p183.jpg">
<img class="clearcenter" alt=
"Ancient tobacco pipe"
title=
"Ancient tobacco pipe"
src="images/p183.jpg" />
</a>was going on, a tobacco pipe of ancient and foreign fashion
was found behind the old wainscot.&nbsp; The stem was a crooked
shoot of bamboo, through which a hole had been bored, and a brass
ornamental termination (of an Elizabethan pattern) formed the
head of the pipe.&mdash;Why may not this have been the pipe of
that Bishop of London who had risen into Elizabeth&rsquo;s favour
by attending Mary on the scaffold at Fotheringay, and who, having
fallen into disgrace in consequence of a second marriage at an
advanced period of his life, sought, we are told, in the
retirement of his house at Fulham, &ldquo;to lose his sorrow in a
mist of smoke,&rdquo;&mdash;and actually died there suddenly on
the 15th June, 1596, &ldquo;while sitting in his chair and
smoking tobacco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could this have been the tobacco pipe produced at
&ldquo;Crowner&rsquo;s &rsquo;quest&rdquo; assembled at the
Golden Lion to inquire into the cause of his lordship&rsquo;s
sudden death?&nbsp; It is not even impossible that it may have
been produced there by his son, John Fletcher, whose name is
associated with that of Francis Beaumont in our literature.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Knight has set the example of an imaginary
biography of Shakespeare, and has brought many probable and some
improbable things together on the subject.&mdash;Why, then, has
he overlooked the Golden Lion in Fulham?&nbsp; The name of John
Fletcher naturally leads to this question.&nbsp; At the time of
his father&rsquo;s death, he was in his twentieth year; and who
will doubt that, at that period of his life, his father&rsquo;s
(the Bishop&rsquo;s) house was his home.&nbsp; That he may have
resorted to the Golden Lion, and there have met with Shakespeare,
is, therefore, quite as probable as that our great dramatist
associated with Fletcher at the Falcon or the Mermaid, if good
cause can only be shown for Shakespeare&rsquo;s having had as
much reason to frequent Fulham as the Bank-side&mdash;or Borough
of London.</p>
<p><!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>I have already stated that Florio&rsquo;s house was
assessed for the poor-rate in Fulham Street, on the 12th October,
1625, the year of Florio&rsquo;s death; and be it remembered that
Florio was the translator of Montaigne&rsquo;s Essays, of which a
copy of the original edition, bearing Shakespeare&rsquo;s very
rare autograph, was not very long since purchased by the British
Museum, at what was considered to be a very large price.&nbsp;
When the genuineness of that autograph was keenly discussed among
antiquaries, and the probable date at which the
&lsquo;Tempest&rsquo; was written, became a question, no one
presumed to deny that the coincidences between the passage in the
2nd Act of the &lsquo;Tempest&rsquo; where Gonzalo
says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo; the commonwealth I would by contraries<br />
Execute all things; for <i>no kind of traffic</i><br />
Would I admit; <i>no name of magistrate</i>;<br />
Letters should not be known: <i>riches</i>, <i>poverty</i>,<br />
<i>And use of service</i>, none: contract, <i>succession</i>;<br
/>
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;<br />
No use of metal, corn or wine or oil;<br />
No occupation; all men idle, all;<br />
And women too; but innocent and pure:<br />
No Sovereignty:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>is but an echo of the following in Florio&rsquo;s translation
of Montaigne:&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;It is a nation, would I answer Plato, that hath
<i>no kind of traffic</i>, no knowledge of letters, no
intelligence of numbers, <i>no name of magistrate</i>, nor of
politic superiority; no <i>use of service</i>, of <i>riches</i>,
or of <i>poverty</i>; no <i>contracts</i>, no <i>successions</i>;
no occupation, but idle, no respect of kindred but common; no
apparel, but natural; no manuring of lands, no use of wine, corn,
or metal,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There are other coincidences also, free from the very great
difficulty of reconciling satisfactorily printed dates with an
imaginary career&mdash;which coincidences are too remarkable to
have escaped the host of ingenious commentators upon the supposed
sources of Shakespeare&rsquo;s information&mdash;of his
observation what shall I say?</p>
<p>The coincidence between passages in Daniel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Civil Warres,&rdquo; published in 1595, and passages in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Richard II., induce Mr. Charles Knight to
observe that &ldquo;We&rdquo;&mdash;thereby meaning
himself&mdash;&ldquo;have looked at this poem with some care, and
we cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that, with reference to
parts of the conduct of the story, and in a few modes of
expression, each of which differs from the general narrative and
the particular language of the chroniclers, there are
similarities betwixt Shakespeare and Daniel which <!-- page
185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>would lead to the conclusion either that the poem of
Daniel was known to Shakespeare, or the play of Shakespeare was
known to Daniel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This position is, indeed, established by Mr. Knight, who
arrives satisfactorily enough for his own conclusion, that of
fixing the date of the composition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s play to
1597; adding, candidly enough, that &ldquo;the exact date is
really of very little importance; and we should not have dwelt
upon it had it not been pleasant to trace resemblances between
contemporary poets, who were themselves personal
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, with regard to dates, and the disputed dates of the
composition of the &lsquo;Tempest,&rsquo; it is important to
ascertain who John Florio and Samuel Daniel were.</p>
<p>We know that Florio was the Italian scholar of his day, and
the Court favourite.&nbsp; We know that Daniel, whose name is now
scarcely popularly remembered, was helped into the office of
poet-laureat by his connection with Florio as his brother-in-law,
by Florio&rsquo;s recommendations to be the successor of
&ldquo;that poor poet, Edmund Spenser.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, at
once, by admitting Shakespeare&rsquo;s personal intimacy with
Florio and Daniel, with his knowledge of their writings, there
can be no question; and supposing that he had seen Florio&rsquo;s
translation of Montaigne in MS., much difficulty about dates is
got rid of, and we can account for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
acquaintance with Italian literature.</p>
<p>And allow me to add to this the fact noticed by Mr. Collier,
in his memoirs of the principal actors in the plays of
Shakespeare, printed for the Shakespeare Society, that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s fellow-player, Henry Condell, did some time
sojourn at Fulham; for a tract printed in 1625, entitled
&lsquo;The Runaway&rsquo;s Answer to a book &ldquo;A Rod for
Runaways,&rdquo;&rsquo; in reply to a pamphlet published by
Decker, is inscribed &ldquo;to our much respected and very worthy
friend, Mr. H. Condell, at his country house at
Fulham.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, couple with the name of Condell that
of Burbadge, in 1625, at Fulham; is not the association most
extraordinary, although there is no further agreement in the
Christian name than the first letter, Robert being that in the
Fulham assessment of poor-rates, Richard that of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s fellow-actor.&nbsp; The family name of
Burbadge, however, belongs not to Middlesex, but to
Warwickshire.&nbsp; Alas! for the credit sake of &lsquo;Robert
Burbadge, of Northend, Fulham,&rsquo; in the place in the
poor-rate assessment of 1625, where the sum should have been
inserted, there is a blank; although twenty-two of his neighbours
at North End are contributors of sums varying from 6s. 8d. to
1s.</p>
<p>Joshua Sylvester, who was born in 1563 or 1564, and died in
1618, <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>thus describes the village of North
End, Fulham, where his uncle Plumbe resided, and he (Sylvester)
formed the attachment which is the subject of his
poem:&mdash;</p>
<p>I was wont (for my disport)<br />
Often in the summer season,<br />
To a Village to resort<br />
Famous for the rathe ripe peason,<br />
Where beneath a <i>Plumb</i>-tree shade<br />
Many pleasant walks I made.</p>
<p>And Norden, whom we consider as the father of English
topography, dates the address &ldquo;to all courteous
gentlemen,&rdquo; prefixed to his account of Middlesex and
Hertfordshire, from his &ldquo;poore home, near Fulham, 4th
November, 1596.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, then, we have a mass of facts, which render it
impossible for us to doubt that the Golden Lion, Fulham, must
have been, according to the custom of the times, frequented by
Florio and his brother-in-law Daniel; by Fletcher; by Henry
Condell, Shakespeare&rsquo;s fellow-player; by some one of the
name of Burbadge; by Joshua Sylvester, and John Norden, about the
years 1595 and 1596.&nbsp; Is there not, then, every reasonable
presumption that our immortal Shakespeare was also a member of
this clique?</p>

<p>On the pulling down of the Old Inn by Mr. Powell, the
panelling was purchased by Mr. Street, of Brewer Street, and <!--
page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

fitting up of his Lordship&rsquo;s residence, Southam House,
Cheltenham.</p>
<p>Fulham High Street, which extends from the London Road to
Church Row, appears to have been denominated Bear Street, and is
called in the more ancient parish books Fulham Street.&nbsp; The
direct approach to Fulham Church is by Church Row, which branches
off to the right of the High Street.&nbsp; On the left of the
churchyard entrance is the Vicarage.&nbsp; The present vicar is
the Rev. R. G. Baker.&nbsp; Opposite the vicarage is a piece of
ground, which was consecrated in 1843 by Bishop Blomfield, who is
buried there.&nbsp; Upon this recent addition to the
burial-ground formerly stood Miss Batsford&rsquo;s seminary for
young gentlemen.&nbsp; There are several curious old monuments in
the church, which have been described and engraved by Faulkner,
to whose work the curious reader may be referred.&nbsp; In the
churchyard are the tombs and monuments of several of the old
bishops of London&mdash;Compton, Robinson, Hayter, Gibson,
Terrick, Lowth, Sherlock, and Randolph.</p>
<p>The grave of that distinguished author and brilliant wit,
Theodore Hook, is immediately opposite the chancel window.&nbsp;
The stone bears the plain inscription &ldquo;Theodore Edward
Hook, died 24th August, 1841, in the fifty-third year of his
age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving the church by the other entrance, we are in Church
Lane.&nbsp; The first house opposite the gate of the churchyard
is Pryor&rsquo;s Bank, to which a separate chapter of our little
volume is devoted, so that we can pass on immediately to the next
house, Thames Bank, the present residence of Mr. Baylis, whose
well-known <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span

pulled down about twenty-five years ago.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s Place
(erected 1844) is on the site.</p>
<p>Next to Thames Bank, formerly stood Egmont Villa, the
residence of Theodore Hook, and the house in which he died, now
pulled down, the back of which, is shown in the annexed
sketch.&nbsp; This house, though of the smallest dimensions, was
fitted up with much good taste.&nbsp;

<img class="floatright" alt=

</a>There was a small boudoir on the side of the drawing-room,
which was very rich in articles of virt&ugrave;, more especially
in some remarkably fine carvings, attributed to Cellini,
Brustolini, and others.&nbsp; These were left to Hook by his
brother, the late Dean of Worcester.&nbsp; <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>As an
improvisatore, Hook was unapproachable.&nbsp; In regard to his
literary merits, let the following suffice, taken from the late
Mr. Barham&rsquo;s life of Hook, published in 1848:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There can be no need,&rdquo; says the
Editor, &ldquo;at this day to enter upon any lengthened criticism
of Theodore Hook&rsquo;s merits as a novelist; they have been
discussed over and over again, with little variety of opinion, by
every reviewer of the kingdom.&nbsp; Indeed, both his faults and
his excellencies lie on the surface, and are obvious and patent
to the most superficial reader; his fables, for the most part ill
knit and insufficient, disappoint as they are unfolded;
repetitions and omissions are frequent: in short, a general want
of care and finish is observable throughout, which must be
attributed to the hurry in which he was compelled to write,
arising from the multiplicity and distracting nature of his
engagements.&nbsp; His tendency to caricature was innate; but
even this would probably have been in a great measure repressed,
had he allowed himself sufficient time for correction: while, on
the contrary, in detached scenes, which sprang up as pictures in
his mind, replete with comic circumstance, in brilliant dialogue
and portraiture of character, not to mention those flashes of
sound wisdom with which ever and anon his pages are lighted up,
his wit and genius had fair play, revelling and rioting in fun,
and achieving on the spur of the moment those lasting triumphs
which cast into the shade the minor and mechanical blemishes to
which we have adverted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hook was a successful dramatist, and an extensive
journalist.&nbsp; Of his novels, &lsquo;Gilbert Gurney&rsquo; may
be considered to be the most remarkable.</p>
<p>Hook&rsquo;s furniture was sold by George Robins, in
September, 1841.&nbsp; In 1855 the aqueduct was erected by the
Chelsea Water Works Company, for conveying the water from
Kingston-upon-Thames to the metropolis, and it was necessary that
the contractor, Mr. Brotherhood, should get possession of Egmont
Villa, to enable them to erect the <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>tower on
the Fulham side.&nbsp; Here the piles and timbers of the old
Bishop&rsquo;s Ferry, used for the conveyance of passengers
across the river from Putney to Fulham, before the old bridge was
built, were discovered.&nbsp; It was subsequently considered
desirable to pull the villa down; and there now remains no trace
of the house in which Hook lived and died, and which stood within
a few paces of his grave.&nbsp; Bowack mentions that Robert
Limpany, Esq., &ldquo;whose estate was so considerable in the
parish that he was commonly called the Lord of Fulham,&rdquo;
resided in a neat house in Church Lane.&nbsp; He died at the age
of ninety-four.&nbsp; Beyond the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank on the right,
is the Bishop&rsquo;s Walk, which runs along the side of the
Thames for some little distance, and from hence a view of the
Bishop&rsquo;s Palace is obtained.&nbsp; This palace has been
from a very early period the summer residence of the Bishops of
London.&nbsp; The land consists of about 37 acres, and the whole
is surrounded by a moat, over which are two bridges.</p>
<p>Following the course of the Bishop&rsquo;s Walk, we come to
the road leading to Craven Cottage, originally built by the
Margravine of Anspach, when Countess of Craven, and since altered
and improved by Walsh Porter, who occasionally resided in it till
his death in 1809.&nbsp; Craven Cottage was considered the
prettiest specimen of cottage architecture then existing.&nbsp;
The three principal reception-rooms were equally remarkable for
their structure, as well as their furniture.&nbsp; The centre, or
principal saloon, supported by large palm-trees of considerable
size, exceedingly well executed, with their drooping foliage at
the top, supporting the cornice and architraves of the
room.&nbsp; The other <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>decorations were in corresponding
taste.&nbsp; The furniture comprised a lion&rsquo;s skin for a
hearth-rug, for a sofa the back of a tiger, the supports of the
tables in most instances were four twisted serpents or hydras: in
fact, the whole of the decorations of the room were of a
character perfectly unique and uniform in their style.&nbsp; This
room led to a large Gothic dining-room of very considerable
dimensions, and on the front of the former apartment was a very
large oval rustic balcony, opposed to which was a large,
half-circular library, that became more celebrated afterwards as
the room in which the highly-gifted and talented author of
&lsquo;Pelham&rsquo; wrote some of his most celebrated works.</p>
<p>Craven Cottage was the residence of the Right Hon. Sir E.
Bulwer-Lytton, from whom it passed to Mr. Baylis, now of Thames
Bank, who parted with it to Sir Ralph Howard, its present
occupant, who removed the door shown in the annexed cut, through
which the library is seen.</p>

<p>Returning to Church Lane, we come out at the bridge, <!-- page
192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>built in 1729, and close to which is Willow Bank, the
late residence of Mr. Delafield and General Conyers.&nbsp; The
Ferry belonged to the See of London, and it was necessary that
the consent of the Bishops should be had, for the erection of the
bridge and consequent destruction of their Ferry; it was,
therefore, stipulated for the right of themselves, their
families, and all their dependents, that they should pass over
the bridge toll free, which right exists at the present time; and
passengers are often very much astonished at hearing the
exclamation of &ldquo;Bishop!&rdquo; shouted out by the
stentorian lungs of bricklayers, carpenters, or others, who may
be going to the palace, that being the pass-word for the
privilege of going over.&nbsp; The architect of the bridge was
the eminent surgeon, W. Cheselden, who died in 1752, and is
buried in the graveyard attached to Chelsea Hospital.&nbsp; His
tomb is close to the railings of the new road, leading from
Sloane Street to the Suspension Bridge at Chelsea.&nbsp;
Cheselden was for many years, surgeon of Chelsea Hospital.</p>

looking on to the river, and scarcely altered in any of its
features since Chatelaine published his views of &ldquo;The most
agreeable Prospects near London,&rdquo; about 1740.&nbsp; It is a
good specimen of a waterside inn, and appears to have been
erected about the time of William III.</p>

<p>Bridge Street brings us to the point at which we turned off at
the termination of the High Street, and on the right-hand side as
we look towards London is Church Street (formerly Windsor Street,
according to Faulkner), leading up to the Ship Tavern, and thence
into the King&rsquo;s Road.</p>
<p>The Charity School is in Church Street.&nbsp; This building
was erected in 1811.</p>
<p>Retracing our steps towards London, we come to the George at
Walham Green, which turns off to the left.&nbsp; The church
stands on the right hand side.&nbsp; Opposite Walham House, near
the church, is North End Lodge, the residence <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>of the late
Mr. Albert Smith, and where he died on the 23rd May, 1860.&nbsp;
As novelist, dramatist, and lecturer, he had achieved
considerable reputation; and his unexpected death, at the early
age of forty-four, brought to a sudden close the most popular
monologue entertainment of this, or of any, time.&nbsp; Mr. Smith
was an amusing writer and a most genial companion, and was ever
ready to assist a professional brother in the hour of need.&nbsp;
Against the brick wall, close to the gate of North End Lodge, is
a slab with the inscription &ldquo;From Hyde Park Corner, 3 miles
17 yards.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are now in North End, where there are
many houses of interest which deserve attention; we will
therefore go out of the direct road and return to London by way
of North End.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">North End</span> may be described as a
series of residences on each side the lane, more than a mile in
length, which runs from the church at Walham Green to the main
road from Kensington to Hammersmith.&nbsp; There were but few
houses in it when Faulkner published his map in 1813.&nbsp;
Market gardens were on both sides the road, and the gardeners
cottagers were very old.&nbsp;

</a>The panelled door, here represented, was fitted to one of
them, and evidently was fashioned in the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; The celebrated bookseller, Jacob Tonson, lived for
some time at North End.&nbsp; At York Cottage, which is on the
right hand side of the road, about a quarter of a mile from the
church, resided for many years Mr. J. B. Pyne, the landscape
painter.&nbsp; At a short distance beyond, the road from Old
Brompton crosses into Fulham Fields.&nbsp; Here, at one corner,
is a house (Hermitage Lodge) which was originally constructed as
stables to the residence of <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>Foote, the
dramatist and comedian, <a name="citation196"></a><a
href="#footnote196" class="citation">[196]</a> which still stands
on the opposite side of the road leading to Brompton, and where
he lived for many years, expending large sums upon its
improvement.&nbsp; It is now called &ldquo;The Hermitage,&rdquo;
and is completely surrounded by a large garden enclosed by high
walls.</p>

<p>Exactly opposite to this house, in the angle of the road,
stands an old house in a moderate-sized garden (Cambridge
Lodge).&nbsp; Francis Bartolozzi, the celebrated engraver, who
arrived in England in 1764, came to reside here in 1777.&nbsp; He
was born at Florence in 1730, and died at Lisbon in 1813.&nbsp;
His son, Gaetano Bartolozzi, father to the late Madame Vestris,
was born in 1757, and died August 25th, 1813.&nbsp; Passing up
the road, beside market gardens, is the old garden wall of
Normand House, with some curious brick gates (now closed in): the
house is very old; the <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>date, 1661,
is in the centre arch, over the principal gateway, and it is said
to have been used as a hospital for persons recovering from the
Great Plague in 1665.&nbsp;

</a>Sir E. Bulwer Lytton has resided here.&nbsp; In 1813
&ldquo;it was appropriated for the reception of insane
ladies&rdquo; (Faulkner), and it is now a lunatic asylum for
ladies, with the name of &ldquo;Talfourd&rdquo; on a brass
plate.&nbsp; A little further on the road, out of which we have
turned, is a cottage to the right named Wentworth Cottage.&nbsp;
Here Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall once resided.&nbsp; The willow in
front of the cottage was planted by them from a slip of that over
the grave of Napoleon at St. Helena.&nbsp; The land opposite this
cottage is now to be let on building lease.&nbsp; This district,
now known as &ldquo;Fulham Fields,&rdquo; was formerly called
&ldquo;No Man&rsquo;s Land,&rdquo; and according to Faulkner, the
local historian, contained, in 1813, &ldquo;about six
houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of these was &ldquo;an ancient house,
once the residence of the family of Plumbe,&rdquo; which was
pulled down about twenty-three years ago, and replaced by a
cluster of dwellings for the labourers in the surrounding market
gardens, which extend from Walham Green nearly to the Thames in a
north-west direction; &ldquo;the North End Road,&rdquo; as it is
called, forming the eastern boundary of &ldquo;Fulham
Fields.&rdquo;&nbsp; To establish <!-- page 198--><a

connection of Sylvester&rsquo;s lines, quoted in the late Mr.
Crofton Croker&rsquo;s Paper on the &ldquo;Golden Lion,&rdquo;
with this locality, the antiquary who pointed it out observed
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our poet had an uncle named William Plumbe,
who resided at North End, Fulham, having married the widow of
John Gresham, the second son of Sir John Gresham, who was Lord
Mayor of London in 1547, and which lady was the only daughter and
heir of Edward Dormer of Fulham.&nbsp; Here it was, while
visiting his uncle, that Sylvester formed the attachment which is
the subject of his poem (see the folio edition of his works,
1621).&nbsp; Uncle Plumbe had been a widower; and from monuments
which exist, or existed, in the parish church of Fulham, appears
to have departed this life on the 9th February, 1593&ndash;4,
aged sixty.&nbsp; In the previous May, his widow had lost her son
Edmund (or Edward) Gresham, at the age of sixteen; and seriously
touched by the rapid proofs of mortality within her house, from
which the hand of death had within twelve months removed both a
husband and a child, made preparations for her own demise by
recording her intention to repose beside their remains: and to
her husband&rsquo;s memory she raised, in Fulham Church, a
monument &lsquo;of alabaster, inlaid and ornamented with
various-coloured marble,&rsquo; leaving a space after her name
for the insertion of the date of her death and age, which appear
never to have been supplied.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arms of &ldquo;Dormer, impaled with Gresham,&rdquo; we are
told remain, &ldquo;those of Plumbe are gone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sylvester&rsquo;s &ldquo;Triumph of Faith&rdquo; is consecrated
&ldquo;to the grateful memory of the first kind fosterer of our
tender Muses, by my never sufficiently honoured dear uncle, W.
Plumb, Esq.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not our intention to linger over
the recollections connected with the age of Elizabeth in Fulham
Fields or at North End, although there can be no doubt that a
little research might bring some curious local particulars to
light connected with the history of the literature, the drama,
and the fine arts of that period,</p>
<p><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>The gardens here provide the London markets with a
large supply of vegetables.&nbsp; A very primitive form of
draw-well was common here, consisting of a pole, balanced
horizontally on an upright, the bucket being affixed to a rope at
one end.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p199a.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=

</a>The pole is pulled downward for the bucket to descend the
well, and when filled, is raised by the weight of wood attached
to the opposite end of the pole.&nbsp; This mode of raising water
is still in use in the East, and Wilkinson, in his &lsquo;Manners
and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,&rsquo; Series I. vol. ii.
p. 4, has engraved representations of this machine, from
paintings on the walls of Thebes, of the time of the

cottages, inhabited by market-gardeners.&nbsp; A sketch, taken in
1844, of one of the best examples then existing, is here given as
a specimen.</p>
<p>A little beyond &ldquo;Wentworth Cottage,&rdquo; the road
branches off, the turning to the right going to Hammersmith, and
that to the left leading to Fulham.&nbsp; Hammersmith was a part
of Fulham until 1834, when it was formed into a separate parish
by Act of Parliament.</p>

</a>Returning to the lane at North End, immediately beyond
Bartolozzi&rsquo;s house, is an old wall, apparently of the time
of Charles II., enclosing a tall peculiar-looking house, now
called Elm House, once the residence of Cheeseman the engraver,
of whom little is known, except that he was a pupil of
Bartolozzi, and lived in Newman Street about thirty years
ago.&nbsp; He is said to have been very fond of music, and having
a small independence and less ambition, he was content to engrave
but little, and with his violoncello and musical friends, passed
a very happy life.</p>
<p>A little further on the opposite side of the road stood
Walnut-Tree Cottage (pulled down in 1846), once the residence of
Edmund Kean, and also of Copley the artist, which took its name
from the tree in the fore-court.&nbsp;

</a>We then come to the North End Sunday and Day Schools, erected
in 1857.&nbsp; The road here curves round by the wall of
Kensington Hall, a large mansion on the right, built by Slater,
the well-known <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>butcher of Kensington, and it has
been called in consequence Slater&rsquo;s Mansion.&nbsp; It is at
present a school, kept by Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, but it is to be
let or sold.</p>
<p>A little further to the left is Deadman&rsquo;s Lane.&nbsp;
Here, in the midst of garden grounds, stands a venerable and
isolated fabric, which would appear to have been built in the
reign of James I.&nbsp; This lane leads to Hammersmith, but a
more agreeable way has been made opposite Edith Villas, called
Edith Road.&nbsp; The land is to be let on building lease; and
here once stood the house of Cipriani, the painter.&nbsp;

</a>Cipriani was born at Florence, in 1727, and died in London in
1785.&nbsp; He came to England in 1755; and he was one of the
members of the Royal Academy at its foundation in 1769, when he
was employed to make the design for the diploma given to
Academicians and Associates on their admission, which was
engraved by Bartolozzi.&nbsp; The character and works of this
artist are thus described by Fuseli: &ldquo;The fertility of his
invention, the graces of his composition, and the seductive
elegance of his forms, were only surpassed by the probity of his
character, the simplicity of his manners, and the benevolence of
his heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few plates were engraved by himself
after his own designs.</p>
<p><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

</a>Dr. Crotch was, in 1797, at the early age of twenty-two,
appointed Professor of Music in the University of Oxford, where
he received the degree of Doctor of Music.&nbsp; In 1822 he was
appointed Principal of the Royal Academy of Music.&nbsp; He
performed for the last time in public in 1834 in Westminster
Abbey, during the royal festival, and died 20th December, 1847,
while sitting at dinner.&nbsp; Dr. Crotch has composed numerous
pieces for the organ and pianoforte, and published, in 1812,
&lsquo;Elements of Musical Composition and Thorough Bass,&rsquo;
and subsequently specimens of various styles of music of all
ages.&nbsp; W. Wynne Ryland, the engraver, lived in this house
before Dr. Crotch inhabited it.</p>
<p>Opposite where Dr. Crotch&rsquo;s house formerly stood, facing
a turning which is called on one side Lawn Terrace, on the other
Ashton Terrace, is a large brick mansion inhabited by Richardson
the novelist before his removal to Parson&rsquo;s Green.&nbsp; It
is of the period of William III., the appearance of which may be
recognized from the annexed sketch.&nbsp; In the garden was a
summer-house, in which the novelist wrote before the family were
up, and he afterwards, at the <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>breakfast
table, communicated the progress of his story.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p203.jpg">

</a>How little the exterior has been altered in the last fifty
years, a comparison of this sketch, made in 1844, with the print
prefixed to the 4th volume of Richardson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Correspondence,&rsquo; will show at a glance.&nbsp; Sir
Richard Phillips&rsquo;s print was published by him May 26,
1804.&nbsp; Then, as now, this mansion was divided into two
houses, and the half nearest to the eye was that occupied by the
novelist, the other half was the residence of a Mr. Vanderplank,
a name which frequently occurs in &lsquo;Richardson&rsquo;s
Correspondence.&rsquo;&nbsp; Richardson&rsquo;s house has been
subsequently inhabited by the late Sir William and Lady Boothby,
the latter, better known to the public as that charming actress
Mrs. Nisbett.&nbsp; A few extracts from &lsquo;Richardson&rsquo;s
Correspondence&rsquo; may here prove interesting.</p>
<p>One of the most romantic incidents in the business-like and
hospitable life of Richardson, was his correspondence with, and
introduction to Lady Bradshaigh, the wife of a Lancashire
Baronet, whom he tried to prevail upon to visit him at North
End.&nbsp; After the appearance of the fourth volume of Clarissa
Harlowe, a lady, who signed herself Belfour, wrote to Richardson,
stating a report that prevailed, that the history of Clarissa was
to terminate in a <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>most tragical manner, and requesting
that her entreaties may avert so dreadful a catastrophe.</p>
<p>This correspondence with Mrs. Belfour commenced in October,
1748; and she thus concludes her letter to the novelist, her
ladyship taking care to mystify her identity by giving her
address, Post-office, Exeter, although resident at Haigh in
Lancashire.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you disappoint me,&rdquo; she writes,
&ldquo;attend to my curse.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May the hatred of all the young, beautiful,
and virtuous for ever be your portion, and may your eyes never
behold anything but age and deformity!&nbsp; May you meet with
applause only from envious old maids, surly bachelors, and
tyrannical parents; may you be doomed to the company of such! and
after death may their ugly souls haunt you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now make Lovelace and Clarissa unhappy if you dare!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you may think all this proceeds from a giddy
girl of sixteen; but know I am past my romantic time of life,
though young enough to wish two lovers happy in a married
state.&nbsp; As I myself am in that class, it makes me still more
anxious for the lovely pair.&nbsp; I have a common understanding,
and middling judgment, for one of my sex, which I tell you for
fear you should not find it out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The correspondence thus commenced goes on, until the vanity of
Richardson induces him to describe to his unknown correspondent
his private circumstances: and to a hint given in the January
following by Lady Bradshaigh, of her intention to visit London
before she is a year older, when she &ldquo;shall long to
see&rdquo; Mr. Richardson, and &ldquo;perhaps may contrive
<i>that</i>, though unknown to him,&rdquo; he replies,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But do not, my dear correspondent (still
let me call you so) say, that you will see me, <i>unknown to
myself</i>, when you come to town.&nbsp; Permit me to hope, that
you will not be personally a stranger to me then.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>This is followed by an acknowledgment from Madame
Belfour, that she is not his &ldquo;Devonshire lady,&rdquo;
having but very little knowledge of the place, though she has a
friend there; observing archly, &ldquo;<i>Lancashire</i>, if you
please;&rdquo; adding an invitation, if he is inclined to take a
journey of two hundred miles, with the promise of &ldquo;a most
friendly reception from two persons, who have great reason to
esteem&rdquo; him &ldquo;a very valuable acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richardson responded to this invitation by another&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But I will readily come into any proposal
you shall make, to answer the purpose of your question; and if
you will be so cruel as to keep yourself still incognito, will
acquiesce.&nbsp; I wish you would accept of our invitation on
your coming to town.&nbsp; <i>But three little miles from Hyde
Park Corner</i>.&nbsp; I keep no vehicle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This was before the age of omnibuses.)</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;but one should be at yours, and at
your dear man&rsquo;s command, as long as you should both honour
us with your presence.&nbsp; You shall be only the sister, the
cousin, the niece&mdash;the what you please of my incognito, and
I will never address you as other than what you choose to pass
for.&nbsp; If you knew, Madam, you would not question that I am
in earnest on this occasion; the less question it, as that at my
little habitation near Hammersmith, I have common conveniences,
though not splendid ones, to make my offer good.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richardson, in the letter from which this passage has been
extracted, is again led away by his vanity into a description of
his person, and very plainly hints at a meeting in the Park,
through which he goes &ldquo;once or twice a week to&rdquo; his
&ldquo;little retirement.&rdquo;&nbsp; He describes himself
as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Short, rather plump than emaciated, about
five foot five inches; fair wig; lightish cloth coat, all black
besides; one hand generally in his bosom, the other a cane in it,
which he leans upon under the <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>skirts of
his coat usually, that it may imperceptibly serve him as a
support, when attacked by sudden tremors or startings and
dizziness.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;Of a light-brown complexion; teeth
not yet failing him; smoothish faced and ruddy cheeked; at some
times looking to be about sixty-five, at other times much
younger; a regular even pace, stealing away ground, rather than
seeming to get rid of it; a grey eye, too often overclouded by
mistiness from the head; by chance lively&mdash;very lively it
will be if he have hope of seeing a lady whom he loves and
honours; his eye always on the ladies&rdquo;&mdash;and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In return to this description, Lady Bradshaigh on the 16th
December, 1749, half promises a meeting in an appointed place,
for she tells the elderly gentleman with &ldquo;a grey eye, too
often overclouded by mistiness from the head,&rdquo; but
&ldquo;by chance lively,&rdquo; &ldquo;that she will attend the
Park every fine warm day, between the hours of one and two.&nbsp;
I do not,&rdquo; adds this perfect specimen of a literary
coquette,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Say this to put you in the least out of
your way, or make you stay a moment longer than your business
requires; for a walk in the Park is an excuse she uses for her
health; and as she designs staying some months in town, if she
misses you one day she may have luck another.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Lady Bradshaigh proceeds to present, as if in ridicule of
Richardson&rsquo;s portrait as drawn by himself, her own.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In surprise or eagerness she is apt to
think aloud; and since you have a mind to see <i>her</i>, who has
seen the King, I give you the advantage of knowing she is middle
aged, middle sized, a degree above plump, brown as an oak
wainscot, a good deal of country red in her cheeks: altogether a
plain woman, but nothing remarkably forbidding.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any one might think that a meeting would immediately have
followed these communications, and that the novel-writer and the
novel-reader would have presented <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>themselves
to each other&rsquo;s gaze for admiration, at the time and place
appointed, and thus the affair which their letters have left upon
record might have been satisfactorily wound up in one
volume.&nbsp; But this did not accord with the sentimental
typographical taste of the times, which required the dilution of
an idea into seven or eight volumes to make it palatable.&nbsp;
For we are told that a young Cantab, who, when asked if he had
read Clarissa, replied, &ldquo;D---n it, I would not read it
through to save my life,&rdquo; was set down as an incurable
dunce.&nbsp; And that a lady reading to her maid, whilst she
curled her hair, the seventh volume of Clarissa, the poor girl
let fall such a shower of tears that they wetted her
mistress&rsquo;s head so much, she had to send her out of the
room to compose herself.&nbsp; Upon the maid being asked the
cause of her grief, she said, &ldquo;Oh, madam, to see such
goodness and innocence in such distress,&rdquo; and her lady
rewarded her with a crown for the answer.</p>
<p>January the 9th (1749&ndash;50) has arrived&mdash;the
tantalizing Lady Bradshaigh, the unknown Mrs. Belfour has been in
London six weeks, and the novelist begins &ldquo;not to know what
to think&rdquo; of his fair correspondent&rsquo;s wish to see
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; he writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But with such a desire to be in town three
weeks; on the 16th December to be in sight of my dwelling, and
three weeks more to elapse, yet I neither to see or hear of the
lady; it cannot be that she has so strong a desire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let any one imagine the ridiculousness of the situation of
&ldquo;dear, good, excellent Mr. Richardson&rdquo; at this
time.&nbsp; He had, he confesses,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such a desire to see one who had seen the
King, that&rdquo; (he speaking <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>of himself,
says) &ldquo;though prevented by indisposition from going to my
little retirement on the Saturday, that I had the pleasure of
your letter, I went into the Park on Sunday (it being a very fine
day) in hopes of seeing such a lady as you describe, contenting
myself with dining as I walked, on a sea biscuit which I had put
in my pocket, my family at home, all the time, knowing not what
was become of me.&mdash;A Quixotte!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last Saturday, being a fine warm day, in my way to
North End, I walked backwards and forwards in the Mall, till past
your friend&rsquo;s time of being there (she preparing, possibly,
for the Court, being Twelfth Night!) and I again was
disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 28th January, nineteen days after this was written,
Lady Bradshaigh, in a letter full of satirical banter, which,
however, it may be questionable if Richardson did not receive as
replete with the highest compliments to his genius, says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Indeed, Sir, I resolved, if ever I came to
town, to find out your haunts, if possible, and I have not
&lsquo;said anything that is not,&rsquo; nor am at all naughty in
this respect, for I give you my word, endeavours have not been
wanting.&nbsp; You never go to public places.&nbsp; I knew not
where to look for you (without making myself known) except in the
Park, which place I have frequented most warm days.&nbsp; Once I
fancied I met you; I gave a sort of a fluttering start, and
surprised my company; but presently recollected you would not
deceive me by appearing in a grey, instead of a whitish coat;
besides the cane was wanting, otherwise I might have supposed you
in mourning.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could anything exceed this touch about &ldquo;a grey, instead
of a whitish coat,&rdquo; except the finishing one of the
&ldquo;mole upon your left cheek?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To be sure on the Saturday you mention, I
was dressing for court, as you supposed, and have never been in
the Park upon a Sunday; but you cannot be sure that I have not
seen you.&nbsp; How came I to know that you have a mole upon your
left cheek?&nbsp; But not to make myself appear more knowing than
I am, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Sir, that I have only seen you in
effigy, in company with your Clarissa at Mr. Highmore&rsquo;s,
where I design making you another visit shortly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>All this and much more is followed by a most
tantalizing and puzzling P.S. to poor Richardson.&nbsp; His fair,
or rather &ldquo;brown as an oak-wainscot, with a good
deal-of-country-red in her cheeks&rdquo; correspondent, requests
him &ldquo;to direct only to C. L., and enclose it to Miss J., to
be left at Mrs. G.&rsquo;s&rdquo; etc. etc., previously observing
that, &ldquo;whenever there happens to be a fine Saturday I shall
look for you in the Park, that being the day on which I suppose
you are called that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roused into desperation, Richardson on the 2nd February writes
to Mrs. Belfour as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What pains does my unkind correspondent
take to conceal herself!&nbsp; Loveless thought himself at
liberty to change names without Act of Parliament.&nbsp; I wish,
madam, that Lovelace&mdash;&lsquo;A sad dog,&rsquo; said a
certain lady once, &lsquo;why was he made so wicked, yet so
agreeable?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed and chagrined as I was on Friday night
with the return of my letter, directed to Miss J---, rejected and
refused to be taken in at Mrs. G---&rsquo;s, and with my
servant&rsquo;s bringing me word that the little book I sent on
Thursday night, with a note in it, was also rejected; and the
porter (whom I have never since seen or heard of, nor of the
book) dismissed with an assurance that he must be wrong; my
servant being sent from one Mrs. G--- to another Mrs. G--- at
Millbank; yet I resolved to try my fortune on Saturday in the
Park in my way to North End.&nbsp; The day indeed, thought I, is
not promising; but where so great an earnestness is professed,
and the lady possibly by this time made acquainted with the
disappointment she has given me, who knows but she will be
carried in a chair to the Park, to make me amends, and there
reveal herself?&nbsp; Three different chairs at different views
saw I.&nbsp; My hope, therefore, not so very much out of the way;
but in none of them the lady I wished to see.&nbsp; Up the Mall
walked I, down the Mall, and up again, in my way to North
End.&nbsp; O this dear Will-o&rsquo;-wisp, thought I! when
nearest, furthest off!&nbsp; Why should I, at this time of
life?&nbsp; No bad story, the consecrated rose, say what she
will: and all the spiteful things I could think of I muttered to
myself.&nbsp; And how, Madam, can I banish them from my memory,
<!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>when I see you so very careful to conceal yourself;
when I see you so very apprehensive of my curiosity, and so very
little confiding in my generosity?&nbsp; O Madam! you know me
not! you will not know me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, at North End, your billet, apologizing for
the disappointment was given me.&nbsp; Lud! lud! what a giddy
appearance! thought I.&nbsp; O that I had half the life, the
spirit! of anything worth remembering I could make
memorandums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I say all I thought?&nbsp; I will not.&nbsp; But
if these at last reach your hands, take them as written, as they
were, by Friday night, and believe me to be,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Madam,<br />
&ldquo;Your admirer and humble Servant,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">S. Richardson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Walter Scott says, that &ldquo;the power of
Richardson&rsquo;s painting of his deeper scenes of tragedy has
never been, and probably never will be, excelled;&rdquo; and in
Mrs. Inchbald&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of Richardson,&rsquo; we read,
that &ldquo;as a writer he possessed original genius, and an
unlimited command over the tender passions.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
carried on a foreign literary correspondence, and was on terms of
intimacy with many eminent and literary persons of his time,
particularly Dr. Young, Dr. Johnson, Aaron Hill, and Arthur
Onslow, Esq., Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>
<p>A short distance further on, we enter the Hammersmith Road,
opposite a tavern called &ldquo;The Bell and Anchor,&rdquo; which
stands beside the turnpike, and passing about twenty shops on the
left towards Hammersmith, we notice in the fore-court of a house
called &ldquo;The Cedars,&rdquo; two noble cedar trees of immense
girth, one of which is represented in the accompanying cut.&nbsp;
This was formerly the residence of Sir James Branscomb, who,
according to Faulkner, &ldquo;in his early days had been a
servant to the Earl of Gainsborough, <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>and
afterwards, for upwards of forty years, carried on a lottery
office in Holborn.&nbsp; He was a common-councilman of the Ward
of Farringdon Without, and received the honour of knighthood
during his shrievalty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The house has been a
ladies&rsquo; boarding-school for many years.&nbsp; From the
Kensington Road we can return direct to London, having in this
chapter departed from our even course on the Fulham Road for the
purpose of visiting the North End district.</p>

<p>Nestling in trees beneath the old tower of Fulham Church,
which has been judiciously restored by Mr. George Godwin, there
may be seen from Putney Bridge a remarkable group of houses, the
most conspicuous of which will be conjectured from a passing
glance to belong to the Gothic tribe.&nbsp; This house, which has
been a pet kind of place of the Strawberry Hill class, is called
the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank, and its history can be told in much less
than one hundredth part of the space that a mere catalogue of the
objects of interest which it has contained would occupy.&nbsp; In
fact, the whole edifice, from the kitchen to the bedrooms, was a
few years since a museum, arranged with a view to pictorial
effect; and if it had been called &ldquo;The Museum of British
Antiquities&rdquo; it would have been found worthy of the
name.</p>
<p>In a print, published about forty years since, by J. Edington,
64 Gracechurch Street, of Fulham Church, as seen from the river,
the ancient aspect of the modern Pryor&rsquo;s Bank is
preserved.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p213a.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=

</a>The situation of this humble <!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>residence
having attracted the fancy of Mr. Walsh Porter, he purchased it,
raised the building by an additional story, replaced its latticed
casements by windows of coloured glass, and fitted the interior
with grotesque embellishments and theatrical decorations.&nbsp;
The entrance hall was called the robber&rsquo;s cave, for it was
constructed of material made to look like large projecting rocks,
with a winding staircase, and mysterious in-and-out
passages.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p213b.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=
"Vine Cottage"
title=
"Vine Cottage"
src="images/p213b.jpg" />
</a>One of the bed-rooms was called, not inaptly, the
lion&rsquo;s den.&nbsp; The dining-room represented, on a small
scale, the ruins of Tintern Abbey; and here Mr. Porter had
frequently the honour of receiving and entertaining George IV.,
when Prince of Wales.&nbsp; It was then called Vine Cottage, <a
name="citation213"></a><a href="#footnote213"
class="citation">[213]</a> and having been disposed <!-- page
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>of
by Mr. Porter, became, in 1813, the residence of Lady Hawarden;
and, subsequently, of William Holmes, Esq., M.P., who sold it to
Mr. Baylis and Mr. Lechmere Whitmore about 1834.</p>
<p>By them a luxurious vine which covered the exterior was cut
down, and the cottage, named after it, replaced by a modern
antique house.&nbsp; Mr. Baylis being a zealous antiquary, his
good taste induced him to respect neglected things, when
remarkable as works of art, and inspired him and his friend Mr.
Whitmore with the wish to collect and preserve some of the many
fine specimens of ancient manufacture that had found their way
into this country from the Continent, as well as to rescue from
destruction relics of Old England.&nbsp; In the monuments and
carvings which had been removed from dilapidated churches, and in
the furniture which had been turned out of the noble mansions of
England&mdash;the &ldquo;Halls&rdquo; and &ldquo;old
Places&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Baylis saw the tangible records of the
history of his country; and, desirous of upholding such
memorials, he gleaned a rich harvest from the lumber of
brokers&rsquo; shops, and saved from oblivion articles
illustrative of various tastes and periods, that were daily in
the course of macadamisation or of being consumed for
firewood.</p>
<p>The materials thus acquired were freely used by him in the
construction of a new building upon the site of Vine Cottage, and
adapted with considerable skill; but when neither the vine nor
the cottage were in existence, it appeared to Mr. Baylis
ridiculous to allow a misnomer to attach itself to the
spot.&nbsp; After due deliberation, therefore, respecting the
situation upon a delightful bank of gravel, <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>and the
association which an assemblage of ecclesiastic carvings and
objects connected with &ldquo;monkish memories,&rdquo; there
collected, were likely to produce upon the mind, the new house
was styled the &ldquo;Pryor&rsquo;s Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Horace Walpole&rsquo;s villa was celebrated by the Earl of
Bath, so the charms of the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank have been sung in
&ldquo;the last new ballad on the Fulham regatta&rdquo;&mdash;a
<i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i> circulated at an entertainment given by
the hospitable owners in 1843:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Strawberry Hill has pass&rsquo;d
away,<br />
Every house must have its day;<br />
So in antiquarian rank<br />
Up sprung here the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank,<br />
Full of glorious tapestry,&mdash;<br />
Full as well as house can be:<br />
And of carvings old and quaint,<br />
Relics of some mitr&rsquo;d saint,<br />
&rsquo;Tis&mdash;I hate to be perfidious&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis a house most sacrilegious.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Glorious, glowing painted glass,<br />
What its beauty can surpass?<br />
Shrines bedeck&rsquo;d with gems we see,<br />
Overhung by canopy<br />
Of embroider&rsquo;d curtains rare&mdash;<br />
Wondrous works of time and care!<br />
Up stairs, down stairs, in the hall,<br />
There is something great or small<br />
To attract the curious eye<br />
Into it to rudely pry.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Here some niche or cabinet<br />
Full of rarities is set;<br />
Here some picture&mdash;&lsquo;precious bit&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
There&rsquo;s no time to dwell on it;<br />
Bronzes, china&mdash;all present<br />
Each their own sweet blandishment.<br />
<!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>But what makes our pleasure here,<br />
Is our welcome and our cheer;<br />
So I&rsquo;ll not say one bit more,&mdash;<br />
Long live Baylis and Whitmore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would endeavour to convey some idea of the Pryor&rsquo;s
Bank and its now dispersed treasures as they were in 1840, in
which year we will suppose the reader to accompany us through the
house and grounds; but before entering the house, I would call
attention to a quiet walk along the garden-terrace, laved to its
verdant slope by the brimming Thames.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p216.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=
"Terrace at Pryor&rsquo;s Bank"
title=
"Terrace at Pryor&rsquo;s Bank"
src="images/p216.jpg" />
</a>Suppose, then, we leave those beautiful climbing
plants&mdash;they are Chilian creepers that so profusely wanton
on the sunny wall&mdash;and turning sharply round an angle of the
river front, cut at once, by the most direct walk, the parties
who in luxurious idleness have assembled about the garden
fountain; and, lest such folk should attempt to interrupt us in
our sober purpose, let us not stop to see or admire anything,
until we reach the bay-window summer-house at the end of the
terrace.&nbsp; &ldquo;How magnificent are those
chestnut-trees!&rdquo; I hear you exclaim; &ldquo;and this old
bay-window!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>Ay, this summer-house which shelters us, and those
noble balusters which protect the northern termination of the
terrace, how many thoughts do they conjure up in the mind!&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p217.jpg">
<img class="floatright" alt=
"Fountain at Pryor&rsquo;s Bank"
title=
"Fountain at Pryor&rsquo;s Bank"
src="images/p217.jpg" />
</a>These balusters belonged to the main staircase of Winchester
House.&nbsp; Do you remember Winchester House in Broad Street, in
the good city of London, the residence of &ldquo;the loyal
Paulets?&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps not.&nbsp; There is, however, a
print of its last appearance in the &lsquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine&rsquo; for April, 1839, and by which you will at once
identify this summer-house as the bay-window of the principal
apartment.&nbsp; Indeed the editor tells you that &ldquo;the
greater part of the remaining ornamental wood-work has been
purchased by Thomas Baylis, Esq., F.S.A., who is fitting up with
it the kitchen and some of the new rooms of his house,
Pryor&rsquo;s Bank, Fulham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is stated in the same magazine, that in 1828 the motto of
the Paulets, <span class="smcap">Aymes Loyaulte</span>, was to be
seen in the windows of the principal apartment on the first
floor, in yellow letters, disposed in diagonal stripes; which
motto, it is added, &ldquo;was probably put there by the loyal
Marquis of Winchester, in the time of Charles I., by whom the
<!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>same sentence was inscribed in every window of his
residence at Basing House, in Hants, which he so gallantly
defended against the Parliamentarians.&rdquo; <a
name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a></p>
<p>Now, is it not more probable that the recollection of this
motto in the windows of his paternal mansion, conveyed through
the medium of coloured glass, indelibly stamped by sunshine (or
daguerreotyped, as we might term it) upon the youthful mind of
the gallant marquis those feelings of devoted loyalty which
influenced his after conduct, and led him to inscribe with the
point of his diamond ring the same motto upon the windows of
Basing House?&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p218.jpg">
<img class="floatleft" alt=
"Turn Buckle"
title=

src="images/p218.jpg" />
</a>Be this as it may, it is gratifying to know that many of the
panes of glass which bore that glorious yellow letter motto in
Winchester House, at the period when it was doomed to be taken

bay-window, as it stood upon the terrace of the Pryor&rsquo;s
Bank, was ancient, and very curious.&nbsp; You could not fail to
remark the quaint window-latch, termed &ldquo;a Turn

<p>You must use your own eyes, and judge for yourself.&nbsp; I
will tell you, however, all that I know as briefly as possible,
and point out whatever occurs to me in our scamper, for a scamper
it can only be termed: just such a kind of run as a person makes
through London who has come up by railroad to see all its wonders
in a week.&nbsp; But I cannot allow you to examine so closely
that curiously <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span

inner hall, although I admit that it may be as early as Henry
VIII.&rsquo;s time, and those interesting old portraits.&nbsp;
Where shall we begin?&nbsp; You wish to inspect everything.&nbsp;
Suppose, then, we commence with the kitchen, and steam it
up-stairs to the dormitories, going at the rate of a
high-pressure engine.</p>
<p>You are already aware that the kitchen was panelled with oak
from the drawing-room of Winchester House, and now you see the
whole style of fitting-up accords with that of &ldquo;bygone
days.&rdquo;&nbsp; Look, for instance, towards the kitchen
window, and you will find that the various cupboards, presses and
dressers&mdash;even the cooking utensils&mdash;correspond; but,
although modern improvements have not been lost sight of, antique
forms have been retained.&nbsp; Let one example suffice, that of
an ancient gridiron, of beautiful and elaborate workmanship.</p>

<p>The history of the plates and dishes displayed in this <!--
page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>kitchen would afford an opportunity for a dissertation
on the rise and progress of the fine arts in this country, as
they present most curious and important specimens of early
drawing, painting, and poetry.&nbsp; The old English plate was a
square piece of wood, which indeed is not quite obsolete at the
present hour.&nbsp; The improvement upon this primitive plate was
a circular platter, with a raised edge; but there were also thin,
circular, flat plates of beech-wood in use for the dessert or
confection, and they were gilt and painted upon one side, and
inscribed with pious, or instructive, or amorous mottoes, suited
to the taste of the society in which they were produced.&nbsp;
Such circular plates are now well known to antiquaries under the
name of &ldquo;roundels,&rdquo; and were at one time generally
supposed by them to have been used as cards for fortune-telling,
or playing with at questions and answers.&nbsp; More sober
research into their origin and use shows that they were painted
and decorated with conventional patterns by nuns, who left blank
spaces for the mottoes, to be supplied by the more learned monks;
and a set of these roundels generally consisted of twelve.&nbsp;
As specimens of the style of these mottoes about the time of
Henry VII. or VIII. the following may be taken:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Wheresoever thou traveleste,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Este, Weste, Northe, or Southe,<br />
Learne never to looke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A geven horsse in the mouthe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;In friends ther ys flattery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In men lyttell trust,<br />
Thoughe fayre they proffer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They be offten unjuste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many sets of verses for roundels extant in <!-- page
223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>manuscript, and a few have been printed; indeed, it
appears likely that to the love for this species of composition
we owe Tusser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Five Hundred Points of Good
Husbandry,&rdquo; and most of his other admonitory verses.</p>
<p>After the Reformation, coloured prints superseded the painted
and manuscript &ldquo;poesies&rdquo; of the nuns and monks, and
the elder De Passe, and other artists of the period of James I.
and Charles I., produced a variety of oval and circular
engravings, which were pasted upon roundels and varnished
over.&nbsp; The subjects generally selected were those which
naturally arranged themselves into a set of twelve, as the
months.&nbsp; By the Puritans the beechen roundels thus decorated
were regarded with especial dislike, and they returned to the use
of the unadorned trencher and &ldquo;godly platter.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When the &ldquo;Merry Monarch&rdquo; was restored he brought over
with him from Holland plates and dishes manufactured at Delft,
where the porcelain known as Faenza, Faience, Majolica, and
Fynlina ware, made during the fifteenth century in the North of
Italy, and upon the embellishments of which, according to
Lamartini&egrave;re, the pencils of Raffaelle, Giulio Romano, and
the Caracci, were employed, had been successfully, although
coarsely imitated.&nbsp; And it must be confessed that many of
the old Dutch plates, dishes, and bowls, upon the kitchen-shelves
of the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank, deserved to be admired for boldness of
design, effective combinations of colour, and the manual
dexterity displayed in the execution of the patterns.&nbsp; The
superior delicacy of the porcelain of China, which about this
time began to be imported freely into England from the East
caused it to <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>be preferred to the &ldquo;Dutch
ware,&rdquo; and the consequence of international commerce was,
that the Chinese imitated European devices and patterns upon
their porcelain, probably with the view of rendering the article
more acceptable in the Dutch and English markets.&nbsp; But while
the Chinese were imitating us, we were copying their style of art
in the potteries of Staffordshire, with the commercial
manufacturing advantage given by the power of transferring a
print to the clay over the production of the same effect by means
of the pencil, an idea no doubt suggested by our roundels of
Charles I.&rsquo;s time, and which process became of the same
relative importance as printing to manuscript.&nbsp; This was the
origin of our common blue-and-white plate, or what is known as
&ldquo;the willow pattern,&rdquo; where</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Walking through their groves of
trees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue bridges and blue rivers,<br />
Little think those three Chinese<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll soon be smash&rsquo;d to
shivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The popularity of this porcelain pattern must not be ascribed
to superior beauty or cheapness, for to the eye of taste surely a
pure plain white plate is infinitely superior to an unfeeling
copy of a Chinese pagoda, bridge, and willow-tree &ldquo;in blue
print.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fact is that the bugbear of a vulgar
mind&mdash;&ldquo;fashion&rdquo;&mdash;long rendered it
imperative upon every good housewife and substantial householder
to keep up a certain dinner-set of earthenware, consisting of two
soup-tureens and a relative proportion of dishes and
vegetable-dishes, with covers, soup-plates, dinner-plates, and
dessert-plates, which were all to correspond; and should any
accidental breakage of crockery take place, it was a
manufacturing trick to make it a matter of <!-- page 225--><a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>extra-proportionate expense and difficulty readily to
replace the same unless it happened to be of &ldquo;the blue
willow pattern.&rdquo;&nbsp; The practice, however, of using for
the dessert-service plates of Worcester china painted by hand,
and the execution of many of which as works of art call for our
admiration as much as any enamel, created a taste for forming
what are called harlequin sets, among which, if a few plates
happen to be</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Smash&rsquo;d to shivers,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the value of the whole set is only proportionately
depreciated, and what has been broken may perhaps be
advantageously replaced.</p>

these curtains manufactured, and yet they are in most excellent
condition.&nbsp; The greater portion of the Gothic oak panelling
around us originally formed the back of the stalls in the
beautiful chapel of Magdalen College, Oxford.&nbsp; During the
late repairs this panelling was removed and sold.&nbsp; Much of
it was purchased by the Marquess of Salisbury for Hatfield House,
and the remainder Mr. Baylis bought.&nbsp; More of the oak
panelling in the room, especially the elaborately-wrought
specimens and the rich tracery work, have been obtained from
Canterbury Cathedral, York Minster, St. Mary&rsquo;s Coventry,
and other churches.</p>

1575.&nbsp; The sideboard, with its canopy of oak, assimilates
with the fitting of the room, and had upon its shelves a
glittering display of ancient glass and early plate.&nbsp;
Salvers and cups of singular forms and beautiful shapes arose
proudly up, one above the other, with dishes of Raffaelle ware
beneath them.&nbsp; But I cannot help seeing that the steel-clad
knight, who keeps guard in a recess by the sideboard, attracts
more of your attention.&nbsp;

jack and an iron jug; the former from St. Cross, Winchester, the
latter from the castle of some German baron, and full of feudal
character.</p>
<p>As for the other relics in the dining-room, I will only <!--
page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

round and solid well-carved pendents from the chancel of the
church of Stratford-on-Avon, which have been removed from their
original station immediately over the tomb of Shakspeare; and are
now, as you see, inverted and used here as footstools.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Think of that, Master Brooke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other relic is that matchless piece of sculptured oak

<img class="floatright" alt=

</a> which represents the Emperor Rudolph II., the size of life
(five feet six inches in height), and which was brought from
Aix-la-Chapelle by the late Sir Herbert Taylor.&nbsp; What may
have been its former history I cannot tell you, but it resembles
in execution the exquisite Gothic figures in the chimney-piece of
the town-hall at Bruges, and is of about the same height and
size.</p>
<p>Are you willing to forsake the thoughtful soberness of antique
oak-panelling for the tinsel of Venetian gold and the richness of
Genoa velvet, Florentine tapestry, and Persian arras?&nbsp; If
so, we will ascend to the drawing-rooms and gallery.&nbsp; But
stay a moment and permit this lady and oddly-dressed gentleman to
pass us on their exit from the gallery, where they have been
rehearsing some charming entertainment for the evening, or
getting <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span

</a>The light is not favourable for seeing all the pictures that
deserve inspection on the staircase&mdash;you had better ascend;
and now, having reached the head of the semi-staircase, our
course is along this lobby to the opposite door-way, which is
that of the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Let us enter at once, and in our tour of the Pryor&rsquo;s
Bank regard the ante-drawing-room as a kind of middle or
passage-room, belonging either to the gallery or the
drawing-room.&nbsp; I admit that the arrangement of the house,
which, however, is very simple, appears puzzling at first: the
reason of this is, that the senses are often deceived, from
mirrors here and there being so judiciously arranged, that they
reflect at happy angles objects which would otherwise escape
observation.&nbsp; It is impossible to convey an idea of the
whole effect of the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank, made up as it has been of
carvings of unrivalled richness, grace, and variety, solemn and
grotesque.&nbsp; Statues are there, some of the highest class of
art, others which belong to an early Gothic period, and yet an
harmonious effect has been produced.&nbsp; Where <!-- page
233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

view?&nbsp; At the other end? or in the oriel window looking on

<p>Now if it were not for that richly gilt Venetian table, the
companion to which is in the possession of the Earl of
Harrington, we might have an excellent view of that magnificently
embellished recess, upon the merits of which Mr. Baylis is
commenting to another oddly equipped gentleman.&nbsp; There
certainly is something going forward in the fancy-dress
way.&nbsp; On this Venetian table stands a French astronomical
clock; upon it are silver medallions of Louis XIII. and XIV., and
among its ornaments the monograms of these monarchs appear.</p>
<p>Here is a group, in ivory, of bacchanals, with attendant <!--
page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<img class="clearcenter" alt=
"Group in Ivory: Tapestried Recess"
title=
"Group in Ivory: Tapestried Recess"
src="images/p234.jpg" />
</a>come this way, we may as well pick up something of the
history of this tapestried recess, the canopy and seats of which,
and the three other recesses in the drawing-room, are fashioned
out of the remains of a large throne or dais brought from
Florence, and which had belonged to the Medici family.&nbsp; The
materials are of the richest possible kind, being flowers of
floss silk upon a ground-work of gold thread, interspersed with
silver.&nbsp; The effect produced by this combination is gorgeous
in the extreme.&nbsp; &ldquo;And those figures?&rdquo;&nbsp; That
nearest the eye is a statue of the Emperor Rudolph of Hapsburgh,
admirably carved in oak, the armour is of silver damasked with
gold.&nbsp; The other <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>figure, and a corresponding one on
the opposite side of the room, represent Gothic queens, whose
robes have been restored in the illuminated style of
decoration.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the tapestry in the
recess?&rdquo;&nbsp; Listen to what Mr. Baylis is saying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thinking over it,&rdquo; remarked Sir Bulwer Lytton to me,
&ldquo;I have very little doubt but that my guess was
right&mdash;that the fisherman is meant for Antony and the lady
for Cleopatra; it was a favourite story in the middle ages, how
Antony, wishing to surprise Cleopatra with his success in
angling, employed a diver to fix fishes on his hook.&nbsp;
Cleopatra found him out, and, in turn, employed a diver of her
own to put waggishly a salt (<i>sea</i>) fish on his
hook.&rdquo;&nbsp; The story is in Plutarch, and the popularity
of the anecdote may be seen by the use Shakspeare makes of
it.&nbsp; Charmian says,&mdash;</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas
merry when<br />
You wagered on your angling; when your diver<br />
Did <i>hang a salt fish on his hook</i>, which he<br />
<i>With fervency</i>, <i>drew up</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation235"></a><a href="#footnote235"
class="citation">[235]</a></p>
<p>It is no doubt correctly conjectured by Sir Bulwer Lytton,
that many subjects in tapestry (not Scriptural) have their
explanation in Plutarch, the fashionable classic source of tale
and legend for our fathers of the middle ages.&nbsp; Shakspeare,
it need scarcely be observed, depends on him for all his classic
plots; and he was no less a favourite on the Continent than with
us.&nbsp; If you observe the attitude and expression of
Cleopatra, for so we will consider her, you will perceive that
there is something impressive, as well as smiling, about her
which would suit the words she <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>is supposed
to have uttered, when she had laughed sufficiently at the trick
she played him, and which, to the best of my recollection, ran
thus, &ldquo;Leave fishing to us smaller potentates; your angling
should be for cities and kingdoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every article of the furniture merits your attention.&nbsp;
Here is a Venetian chair; <a name="citation236"></a><a
href="#footnote236" class="citation">[236]</a> it is one of a set
of twenty-six, with a sofa, brought from the Gradenigo Palace,
and is carved and gilt all over,&mdash;the back, and seat, and
cushions for the arms, being Genoa red velvet.&nbsp;

</a>Fourteen of these chairs, with the sofa, are in this room;
the other twelve were purchased by the Earl of Lonsdale.</p>
<p>Vases of Dresden china, marqueterie tables, and a shrine (see
page 237) of gilt carved work at one end of the room, reflected
in mirrors of gigantic dimensions, dazzle the senses; and its
ceiling studded with blue and gold pendants, and its walls all
painted over with quaint devices like the pages of a
missal.&nbsp; Also a magnificent Gothic chimney-piece (see page
238) of Carrara marble, fitted with brass-work of ormolu and
chimney-glass.&nbsp; The chimney was removed from the grand
Gothic-room at Carlton House, and cost George IV. many hundred
pounds.&nbsp; Indeed the drawing-room of the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank
seems to be more like some scene in an enchanted palace, <!--

<p>I entirely agree with you in thinking it a pity that the

</a> vast labours of our ancestors&mdash;things upon which they
bestowed so much time and thought&mdash;should be blown into
oblivion by the mere breath of fashion.&nbsp; How much nobler is
the fashion to respect, cherish, and admire them!</p>
<p>And now we are again within the gallery, and look upon the
ante-room through the private entrance, and in another second we
might be within the bay-window of the gallery; for, place these
sketches together at a right angle, side by side, and the part of
the sofa which appears in one, is only the continuation of the
same seat in the other.&nbsp; But this must not make you think
that the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank is but a miniature affair, or give
you a contemptible idea of the size.&nbsp; You should rather take
your general notion of the proportions of the gallery from a
glance at that lady who is studying with so much attention the
part she has <!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span

to the comparative height of the window at the top compartments
made up of ancient

</a>painted glass, charged with the arms of some of the medieval
kings of England, among which you cannot fail to notice those of
Richard III.&nbsp; Those two elaborately-wrought lanterns which
depend from the groined ceiling, formerly hung in the Gothic
conservatory of Carlton House, and the recesses of the walls are
adorned with eleven full-length portraits of kings and queens of
Spain painted upon leather.</p>
<p>Look at those ebony and ivory couches, and this ebony chair,
from which justice was formerly meted out by the Dutch and
English rules to the Cingalese; and see here this great chair, so
profusely carved and cushioned with <!-- page 242--><a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>rich black
velvet worked with gold.&nbsp;

</a>It is said to have been the Electoral coronation chair of
Saxony; and the date assigned to it in the &lsquo;Builder&rsquo;
is 1620.&nbsp; The armorial bearings embroidered upon the back
would probably settle the question; but I know little of foreign
heraldry beyond the fact that sufficient attention is not paid to
it in this country.</p>
<p>Attached to the gallery at the opposite end of the lobby from
which we entered the drawing-room, there is a boudoir, or
robing-room&mdash;a perfect gem in its way.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p242b.jpg">

</a>You have only to touch this spring, and that picture starts
from the wall and affords us free egress.&nbsp; Just take one
peep into this fairy boudoir.</p>
<p>There hangs against the wall Nell Gwynne&rsquo;s mirror, in
its curious frame of needlework.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; You wish to take
a peep at yourself in Nelly&rsquo;s looking-glass?&nbsp; Odds,
fish! mind you do not overset that basset table of Japan
manufacture&mdash;another Strawberry Hill relic.&nbsp; Now, are
you satisfied?&nbsp; Those <!-- page 243--><a

enamels, and that charming Bermudian brain-stone, the wonderful
network of which infinitely exceeds the finest lace?&nbsp; Well,
I must admit that some philosophy is required to feel satisfied
when revelling among the ornaments of palaces, the treasures of
monasteries, and the decorations of some of the proudest mansions
of antiquity; and did we not turn our eyes and regard the
infinitely superior works of Nature, alike bountifully spread
before the poor and the rich man, the heart might feel an inward
sickening at the question.&nbsp; In the state carved-oak bed-room
is a finely carved walnut-wood German cabinet of the true
Elizabethan period.</p>

<p>Though within the walls of the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank, or any
other human habitation, all that is rich in art may be <!-- page

244</span>assembled, yet, without the wish to turn these objects
to a beneficial purpose, they become only a load of care; but
when used to exalt and refine the national taste, they confer an
immortality upon the possessor, and render him a benefactor to
his species; when used, also, as accessories to the cultivation
of kindly sympathies and the promotion of social enjoyment, they
are objects of public utility.&nbsp; The revival of old-fashioned
English cordiality, especially at Christmas, had been always a
favourite idea with the owners of the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank, and in
1839 they gave an entertainment which, like</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s noble feast, will
ne&rsquo;er be forgot<br />
By those who were there or those who were not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were fortunate in securing the aid of Theodore Hook, of
pleasant, and, alas! of painful memory, who was their neighbour,
with that of some other friends and acquaintances, who thoroughly
entered into the whim of recalling olden times by the enactment
of masques and other mummeries.</p>
<p>Hook, in his manuscript journal of Thursday, the 26th of
December, 1839, notes that he was engaged to dine with Lady
Quentin at Kew:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Weather dreadful, so resolved to write her
an excuse and came home in coach early, so up to Baylis&rsquo;s,
where I was asked to dine.&nbsp; They came here, and we walked up
together; so to rehearsal, and then back again to bed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hook&rsquo;s letter, in a feigned hand, to Mr. Baylis upon
this occasion ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;Circumstancis hoeing too the Fox
hand wether in Lunnun as indered me of goen two Q.&nbsp; wherefor
hif yew plese i ham reddy to cum <!-- page 245--><a

<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;TEE HEE OOK.&rdquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Manger hof

<i>T.R.P.B. and halso Proper rioter thereof</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Saturday, Hook records in his &lsquo;Diary&rsquo; his
having refused his &ldquo;firmest friend&rsquo;s command&rdquo;
that he should dine with him&mdash;&ldquo;because,&rdquo; writes
Hook, &ldquo;I cannot on account of the things to be done at
Pryor&rsquo;s Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the memorable Monday, the 30th of December, Hook
notes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To-day, not to town, up and to
Baylis&rsquo;s; saw preparations.&nbsp; So, back, wrote a little,
then to dinner, afterwards to dress; so to Pryor&rsquo;s Bank,
there much people,&mdash;Sir George and Lady Whitmore, Mrs.
Stopford, Mrs. Nugent, the Bully&rsquo;s, and various others, to
the amount of 150.&nbsp; I acted the &lsquo;Great Frost&rsquo;
with considerable effect.&nbsp; Jerdan, Planch&eacute;, Nichols,
Holmes and wife, Lane, Crofton Croker, Giffard, Barrow.&nbsp; The
Whitmore family sang beautifully; all went off well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The part of the Great Frost to which Hook alludes was in a
masque, written for the occasion, and printed and sold in the
rooms, for the benefit of the Royal Literary Fund; and among the
record of miscellaneous benefactions to this most admirable
charity are registered&mdash;&ldquo;Christmas masquers and
mummers at the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank, Fulham, the seat of Thomas
Baylis, Esq., F.S.A., and William Lechmere Whitmore, F.S.A.
(1840), &pound;3 12s. 6d.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus carrying out in deed
as well as act the benevolent feelings of the season.</p>
<p>What little plot there was in this production had <!-- page
246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>reference to the season, the house in which it was
performed, and temporary events.&nbsp; Egomet, an imp, most
piquantly personified by Mr. John Barrow, opened the affair in a
moralising strain prophetically applicable to the moment.</p>
<p>After stating who and what he was, he starts:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m all over wonder.<br />
Surely the kitchen must be somewhere under?<br />
But where&rsquo;s <i>the</i> room?&mdash;the matchless little
chamber,<br />
With its dark ceiling, and its light of amber&mdash;<br />
That fairy den, by Price&rsquo;s pencil drawn,<br />
Enchantment&rsquo;s dwelling-place?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
gone&mdash;&rsquo;Tis gone!<br />
The times are changed, I said, and men grown frantic,<br />
Some cross in steamboats o&rsquo;er the vast Atlantic;<br />
Some whirl on railroads, and some fools there are<br />
Who book their places in the pendant car<br />
Of the great Nassau&mdash;monstrous, big balloon!<br />
Poor lunatics! they think they&rsquo;ll reach the moon!<br />
All onward rush in one perpetual ferment,<br />
No rest for mortals till they find interment;<br />
Old England is not what it once has been,<br />
Dogs have their days, and we&rsquo;ve had ours, I ween.<br />
The country&rsquo;s gone! cut up by cruel railroads,<br />
They&rsquo;ll prove to many nothing short of jail-roads.<br />
The spirit vile of restless innovation<br />
At Fulham e&rsquo;en has taken up his station.<br />
I landed here, on Father Thames&rsquo;s banks,<br />
To seek repose, and rest my wearied shanks;<br />
Here, on the grass, where once I could recline,<br />
Like a huge mushroom springs this mansion fine.<br />
Astounding work! but yesterday &rsquo;twas building;<br />
And now what armour, carving, painting, gilding!<br />
Vexed as I am, yet loth to be uncivil,<br />
I only wish the owner at the ---!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Thames (Mr. Giffard), who had been slumbering between
two painted boards, respectively inscribed <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">middlesex county
bank</span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<span class="smcap">surrey
bank</span>,&rdquo; and surrounded by flower-pots filled with
bulrushes and sedge, roused by the intended imprecation upon
their host, here interrupted Egomet, and entered into a long
dialogue with him, in which he detailed all his grievances so far
as gas and steam were concerned.&nbsp; At length he feels the
influence of Hook as &ldquo;the Great Frost,&rdquo; who turns</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The old blackguard to solid
ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which Egomet&rsquo;s remark was, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The scene to Oxford shifted in a trice
is,<br />
This river-god&mdash;no longer Thames, but Isis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Christmas (Mr. Crofton Croker) then appeared with a
long speech about eating, drinking, and making merry, and the
wondrous power that a good fire and a cheerful glass have upon
the heart.&nbsp; Beholding &ldquo;poor Thames
a-cold&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;an icy, heartless
river&rdquo;&mdash;the question follows, what</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do I
the matter see?<br />
I&rsquo;ll thaw you soon&mdash;begone to Battersea,<br />
There let thy icebergs float in Chelsea Reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Great Frost, too, after much buffoonery, turns himself
into</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A pleasant fall of fleecy snow,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which he effected by the vigorous use of the kitchen
dredging-box, and an ample supply of flour, therewith bepowdering
Jolly Christmas, Father Thames, and Egomet, so plentifully as to
leave no doubt upon the minds of the audience respecting the
transformation.</p>
<p>Another Christmas revel followed, and then came &ldquo;a Grand
Tournament,&rdquo; in which a contest between &ldquo;the <!--
page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>Blue Knight&rdquo; (Mr. Lechmere Whitmore), and
&ldquo;the Yellow Knight&rdquo; (Mr. Baylis), each mounted upon
hobby-horses, was most fiercely executed.&nbsp; Nor was the Giant
Cormoran (fourteen feet in height), nor the Queen of Beauty, nor
the Dragon Queen wanted to complete the chivalry of this
burlesque upon the memorable meeting at Eglinton.</p>
<p>The fun which now became</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;fast and furious,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and to which an impudent but most amusing jester (Mr. Jerdan)
mainly contributed, was checked only by the announcement of
supper; and as the guests descended the stairs from the gallery,
or assembled on the lobby, they beheld their cheer borne in
procession from the kitchen, headed by a military band and a
herald-at-arms.&nbsp; A cook, with his cap and apron of snowy
whiteness, placed a boar&rsquo;s head</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bedeck&rsquo;d with bays and
rosemary,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>upon the table; then came two ancient halberdiers, followed by
a serving-man in olden livery, carrying the wassail-bowl; then
another herald in his tabard, and servitors with Christmas-pie,
and brawn, and soup, and turkey, and sirloin of beef, and
collared brawn, whereof was an abundant supply, and of the most
magnificent dimensions.&nbsp; Father Christmas, carving-knife in
hand, and belted with mincepies, and his attendant Egomet, with
followers bearing holly, ivy, and mistletoe, brought up the
rear.&nbsp; Then was sung &ldquo;beautifully,&rdquo; as Hook
notes, by four voices, the Oxford chant of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The boar&rsquo;s head in hand bear
I.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>And here we must drop the curtain, but not without
stating that several of the guests felt the enjoyment of the
evening so warmly, that it was in long debate among them what
suitable acknowledgment in recollection of it should be made to
Mr. Baylis and Mr. Whitmore; and, that the actors in the masque
presented these gentlemen with an ancient charter horn, which had
belonged to the Pickard family, and which they were fortunate
enough to secure.&nbsp; The height of this horn, which is
supposed to be that of the Highland buffalo&mdash;an animal said
to be extinct nearly three hundred years&mdash;is one foot two
inches, its length is one foot six inches, its width at the top
five and a half inches; and it is capable of containing one
gallon.</p>
<p>Upon this most gratifying memorial to the owners of the
Pryor&rsquo;s Bank, of the esteem created by their hospitality,
suitable inscriptions were placed by the donors, with the
motto:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;While Thames doth flow, or wine is
drank,<br />
par-h&aelig;l to all at Pryor&rsquo;s Bank.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ++unc-h&aelig;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remembrance of the pleasant hours passed within the walls
of the Pryor&rsquo;s Bank will not easily be forgotten, though
the character of the interior is changed since this was
written.&nbsp; The first sale took place on the 3rd May, 1841,
and five following days: and there was a subsequent sale on the
25th May, 1854, and four following days.&nbsp; Both these sales
took place on the premises, and the Auctioneer, on both
occasions, was Mr. Deacon.</p>
<p>Pryor&rsquo;s Bank is now let to Mr. E. T. Smith, of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s and Drury Lane Theatres.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
